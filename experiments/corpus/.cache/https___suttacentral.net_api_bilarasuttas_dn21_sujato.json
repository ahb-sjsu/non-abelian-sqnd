{"comment_text": {"dn21:1.1.1": "This late sutta exhibits considerable literary sophistication.

The strings, typically seven in number, were attached to the base of the soundbox and passed through holes in the parchment resonator to be tied with cords to the curved neck (these parts are listed at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.246/en/sujato#4.17'>SN 35.246:4.17</a>).

According to Rāmāyaṇa 3.4, he was cursed with a monstrous form by Kuvera due to an inappropriate lust for the nymph Rambhā. Upon his defeat at the hands of Rāma he was restored to his former status. Pañcasikha would have wanted to avoid a similar fate. Rather than Suriyavaccasā, the Sanskrit literature mentions his daughters Manuvantī and Sukeśī; the latter name (“fair-hair”) evokes the streaming rays of the sun   (Vāyupurāṇa 69.49 = Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa 2.7.13).
