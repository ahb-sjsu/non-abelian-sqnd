", "dn27:8.8": "He is illustrious, I am insignificant.’ ", "dn27:8.9": "Rather, in showing such deference to the Realized One he is only honoring, respecting, and venerating principle. ", "dn27:8.10": "And here’s another way to understand how principle is the best thing for people in both this life and the next.
