These discourses are the most influential texts for modern Theravada meditation, prompting countless modern commentaries. Comparative study of the several parallel versions reveals that this discourse, while comprised almost entirely of early material, was compiled in this form as one of the latest texts in the Pali suttas. | While mindfulness is always useful (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn46.53/en/sujato#15.4'>SN 46.53:15.4</a>), the “establishment of mindfulness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>satipaṭṭhāna</i>) refers especially to a conscious development of contemplative practices based on mindfulness, i.e. “mindfulness meditation” or simply “meditation”. ", "mn10:2.1": "The phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ekāyano maggo</i> (“path to convergence”) is given multiple meanings in commentaries and ancient translations.

At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn47.18/en/sujato#3.4'>SN 47.18:3.4</a> the phrase is spoken by Brahmā, which suggests it was a Brahmanical term. At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.11—a passage full of details shared with the suttas—it means a place where things unite or converge. Thus <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satipaṭṭhāna</i> leads to everything “coming together as one”. In other words, as seventh factor of the noble eightfold path, it leads to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samādhi</i>, the eighth factor (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1/en/sujato#3.9'>SN 45.1:3.9</a>; see also <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn44/en/sujato#12.3'>MN 44:12.3</a>).

Notice how the Buddha phrases it: not “concentrate on the breath” as an object, but rather “breathing” as an activity to which one brings mindfulness. The stages of breath meditation are not meant to be done deliberately, but to be observed and understood as the natural process of deepening meditation. ", "mn10:4.4": "In the beginning, the breath is somewhat rough and coarse. The Pali idiom is “long” and “short” breath, but in English we usually say to breathe “heavily” or “lightly”. ", "mn10:4.5": "Over time, the breath becomes more subtle and soft. ", "mn10:4.6": "Contextually the idiom “whole body” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sabbakāya</i>) here refers to the breath, marking the fuller and more continuous awareness that arises with tranquility.

", "mn10:4.7": "The “physical process” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāyasaṅkhāra</i>) is the breath itself (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn41.6/en/sujato#1.8'>SN 41.6:1.8</a>). This can become so soft as to be imperceptible. ", "mn10:4.8": "Text has “long” and “short”, but “deep” and “shallow” or “heavy” and “light” are more idiomatic for describing the breath in English. ", "mn10:5.1": "“Internally” is one’s own body, “externally” the bodies of others, or external physical phenomena. This distinction is applied broadly in Buddhist meditation, but it is more relevant in some contexts than others. In the case of the breath, one is focusing on one’s own breath, but when contemplating, say, a dead body, or the material elements, there is more of an external dimension. Starting with “me” in here and the “world” out there, this practice dissolves this distinction so that we see we are of the same nature as everything else. ", "mn10:5.2": "This is the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vipassanā</i> (“insight” or “discernment”) dimension of meditation, observing not just the rise and fall of phenomena, but also their conditioned “nature” as being “liable” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>-dhamma</i>) to impermanence. The meaning of this passage is explained at (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn47.42/en/sujato'>SN 47.42</a>).

It is practiced by developing a reflexive awareness of one’s posture and activity as it proceeds, often assisted by moving slowly and carefully. ", "mn10:8.1": "“Situational awareness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sampajañña</i>) understands the context and purpose of activities.

", "mn10:10.1": "This practice is intended to counter sexual desire and obsession. The primary focus is on one’s own body, rather than another’s body, although that can be brought in also. By focusing on aspects of our body that we normally prefer to ignore, we move towards a healthy sense of acceptance and neutrality towards our body. ", "mn10:10.2": "Thirty-one parts are mentioned in early texts, later expanded to thirty-two with the addition of the “brain” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>matthaluṅga</i>).

The same word is used for a monastic student. ", "mn10:14.1": "Cremation was expensive and not available to everyone. Bodies might be left in the charnel ground for a variety of reasons, such as local customs, lack of funds, or in cases of inauspicious death such as murder or execution.

", "mn10:32.2": "Pali employs direct quotes to indicate reflexive awareness: you feel the feeling and you know that you feel the feeling.
