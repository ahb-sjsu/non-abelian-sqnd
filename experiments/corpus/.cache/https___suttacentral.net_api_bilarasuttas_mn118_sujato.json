Inexperienced meditators often take this to signify a profound realization. With patient mindfulness, however, the feelings and perceptions settle down and become unified, so they are no longer experienced as separate things. Just as the physical breath virtually disappeared, here too the feelings and perceptions can become so subtle as to feel like the simple, normal state of the mind.

Here, impermanence is contemplated in the context of mindfulness of breathing itself.

The meditator reflects on these changes and sees not simply that change happens, but how changes happen due to causes.

", "mn118:21.4": "This is the full renunciation of all worldly desires that occurs with arahantship (“perfection”).

The meditator “carefully” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sādhukaṁ</i>) focuses on these feelings as they manifest in the breath. The point is that “breath” is not purely a physical phenomenon. The material property of “air” is its most obvious dimension, but we experience breath as a complex that includes emotional and cognitive dimensions. As the physical process becomes subtle, feeling becomes apparent as an aspect of the breath that has always been there, but not clearly perceived.

At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn10/en/sujato#34.1'>MN 10:34.1</a> the contemplation of mind includes states of mind characterized by greed, hate, and delusion, which are experienced by one lacking mindfulness and awareness. Mindfulness of breathing, however, focuses on the purified mind states of deep meditation.
