{"comment_text": {"mn1:1.1": "Just as the Dīghanikāya begins with the complex and demanding Brahmajālasutta, the Majjhima opens with one of the most abstruse discourses in the entire canon. It examines the ways that the process of perception and identification evolves with progress on the path. It was translated, together with its commentary and extensive analysis, by Bhikkhu Bodhi as <em>The Discourse on the Root of Existence</em>. The commentarial background is also found in the Mūlapariyāya Jātaka (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja245/en/sujato'>Ja 245</a>). The commentary connects this sutta with the Gotamakacetiyasutta (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.125/en/sujato'>AN 3.125</a>), but there is no internal evidence to support this.

While the text certainly responds to ideas and methods of Brahmanical texts, that interpretation is not supported by the text.

The distinctive “conceiving” pattern of this sutta is therefore also applied to the “all” of the six senses (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.30/en/sujato#1.19'>SN 35.30:1.19</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.90/en/sujato#3.7'>SN 35.90:3.7</a>).

", "mn1:3.2": "Although their perception (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saññā</i>) is accurate, to perceive something “as” something is to recognize it filtered through memory and concepts learned in the past, a subtle pre-processing that interprets present experience in light of expectations and desires. | The ending <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-to</i> here and throughout is the “ablative of perspective”, which is used with verbs of cognition to express the idea of seeing something in a certain light; for example, one contemplates the body “as impermanent” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn74/en/sujato#9.1'>MN 74:9.1</a>). ", "mn1:3.3": "To “conceive” or “imagine” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>maññati</i>) is, according to the commentary, to think in terms of a “self”, proliferating experience through craving, conceit, or views until it is constructed <em>for me</em>. This usage draws upon such passages as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.20, where due to ignorance, a person “imagines” in a dream the fearful things they saw when awake, or at the highest level, “imagines I am this all” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ahamevedaṁ sarvo’smīti manyate</i>). | Each of the five phrases takes the “perception of earth as earth” and conceives, imagines, or construes that perception in progressively more differentiated and objectified ways, until it becomes something that is owned and enjoyed.

The concept appears to be Buddhist, but we find a precedent when Yājñavalkya says that, just as salt is “entirely” salty, the Self is an “entire mass of consciousness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kṛtsnaḥ prajñānaghana eva</i>, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.13).

This framework was adopted from Yājñavalkya, for whom it is the Self that must be seen, heard, thought, and known (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.7, 2.4.5, 4.5.6; cf. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3.13.7).

It is through inference or understanding that one can learn to see, hear, think, and know that which is unknown (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.1.3), and which comprises one’s spiritual understanding (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.4.5).

(3) <em>An unenlightened person’s misconception of the Buddhist goal</em>. At least some ancient Buddhists read it this way, as this passage is quoted in an Abhidhamma discussion as to whether the deathless as an object of thought can be a fetter (Kathāvatthu 9.2).

Alternatively, some modern interpreters (Bodhi, Ñāṇananda), relying on the commentarial background explanation, suggest that the problem was that they understood it all too well and were not happy that their beliefs were challenged. These explanations, however, do not take into account the centrality of “approval” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>nanda</i>)—it is literally the “root” that lends the discourse its title. Given that an arahant does not “approve” even Nibbāna, and that “approval” is the root of suffering, is it any wonder that the audience did not “approve” the teaching? It is not that they did not understand, nor that their understanding threatened their egos, but that they understood so well that they received the teaching with perfect equanimity. Elsewhere the Buddha urged that one should “neither approve (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhinandati</i>) nor dismiss” a teaching (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#2.5'>AN 4.180:2.5</a> = <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.8.4'>DN 16:4.8.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#18.4'>DN 29:18.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn112/en/sujato#3.1'>MN 112:3.1</a>). The normal response, where the audience approves a teaching with pleasure, is meant in a conventional sense, whereas this sutta shows how for an arahant all such responses are transcended.
