This particular version focuses on his experience with Brahmanical teachers, while <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato'>MN 36</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato'>MN 85</a>, and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn100/en/sujato'>MN 100</a> include a long passage detailing his Jain-like fervent austerities.

This is puzzling because where we find this trope elsewhere there is a clear reason: at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.52/en/sujato#1.3'>AN 7.52:1.3</a> the Buddha was making one of his rare visits to Campā, while at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.81/en/sujato#3.5'>SN 22.81:3.5</a> he had left the squabbling Sangha for the seclusion of the forest. Here, in the central teaching location of Sāvatthī, there is no such reason. Rather, the events are best understood as narrative foreshadowing. His reluctance requires an intervention by others, and when the teaching finally takes place it is not in a Buddhist monastery but on Brahmanical grounds. The story goes on to tell how, after his awakening, he was reluctant to teach until the intervention of Brahmā (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#19.1'>MN 26:19.1</a>). This narrative mirroring creates a hidden link (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sandhi</i>) that frames the awakening in a Brahmanical context. The very obscurity of the connection is the point, for “the gods love hidden things”. The theme of reluctance is extended further to the reluctance of the five mendicants to receive the Buddha.

Further, in the earliest use of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>svayambhū</i> at Rig Veda 10.83.4, the “self-born” deity Manyu “prevails” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sahuriḥ sahāvān</i>) in battle. Thus we can identify Sahampati, the “Lord Who Prevails”, with the highest divinity recognized by Yājñavalkya, who originated as victor in battle, whose physical manifestation is the sun, whose spiritual function is to imbue all creatures with divinity, and who serves as the ultimate source of authority. Meanwhile, the epithet <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sayambhū</i> was taken for the Buddha (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd11/en/sujato#35.1.37'>Kd 11:35.1.37</a>). ", "mn26:20.2": "Having surpassed the greatest of the Brahmanical contemplatives, the Buddha’s achievement is recognized by the chief Brahmanical divinity. ", "mn26:20.7": "Sahampati is the one who recognizes the potential in all beings, since it was he who imbued them with divinity. He did this to ensure dominance, but now his motive has transformed into compassion. ", "mn26:20.11": "The “impure teaching” was, according to the commentary, that of the six ascetic teachers, who are regularly associated with Magadha (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.30/en/sujato'>SN 2.30</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.6/en/sujato'>Snp 3.6</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato'>DN 2</a>). Less likely it refers to Brahmanical teachers like Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, who are more closely associated with Kosala and whose system is regarded as passed down rather than “thought up”. ", "mn26:20.12": "“Freedom from death” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>amata</i>, Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amṛta</i>) is yet another Brahmanical term transformed by the Buddha. Its Vedic meaning was “immortality”, and hence the “ambrosia” of soma through which immortality was gained.

", "mn26:20.21": "A “caravan leader” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>satthavāha</i>) guides their flock through treacherous deserts and wastelands, as illustrated at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn23/en/sujato#23.3'>DN 23:23.3</a>. | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Anaṇa</i> (“debtless”) is a technical term in the Vedic system. According to Manu 6.35–7, a renunciate must first pay off three debts: study of Vedas, begetting a son, and offering of sacrifices. One who goes forth with these debts unpaid is headed for a downfall. The Buddha has indeed paid off all these debts: he studied the Vedas under his former teachers (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#15.6'>MN 26:15.6</a>); he has a son Rāhula; and his path is regarded as the highest form of sacrifice (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#24.1'>DN 5:24.1</a>). But in Buddhism the concept is reinterpreted as meaning one has let go of all defilements, becoming a “perfected”, literally “worthy” one, after which one can eat almsfood free of debt (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn124/en/sujato#38.1'>MN 124:38.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn16.11/en/sujato#13.2'>SN 16.11:13.2</a>).

It implicitly links back to the five spiritual qualities that the Buddha attributed to his teachers, which he later formalized as “faculties”.
