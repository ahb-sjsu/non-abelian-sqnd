Strikingly, both the current sutta and SN 22.90 share a common narrative pattern. In both cases, an interlocuter (Saccaka or Channa, both known for their conceit) asks for teaching from a lesser teacher (Assaji or unnamed mendicants). Their reply omits suffering, but this fails. So they seek a better teacher (the Buddha, Ānanda) who not only includes suffering, but specially emphasizes it (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#21.2'>MN 35:21.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.90/en/sujato#9.7'>SN 22.90:9.7</a>).
