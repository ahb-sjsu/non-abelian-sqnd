{"comment_text": {"mn38:2.1": "The opening of this sutta is similar to <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn22/en/sujato'>MN 22</a>. ", "mn38:2.2": "Sāti attributes three teachings to the Buddha. First, that there is a “transmigration” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁsāra</i>) from one life to another. Second, that the primary locus of transmigration is “consciousness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>viññāṇa</i>). And thirdly, that the consciousness that transmigrates remains “this very same” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tadevidaṁ</i>), not another (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>anaññaṁ</i>); in other words, it retains its self-same identity through the process of rebirth. The Buddha did in fact teach the first two of these ideas, but not the third, as he will explain below. | The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad says that as death approaches, the senses and vital energies withdraw into the heart (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>hṛdaya</i>), from the top of which the self departs. That same consciousness proceeds to a new body (4.4.2: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>savijñāno bhavati, savijñānamevānvavakrāmati</i>). This core Upaniṣadic chapter on rebirth reflects Sāti’s wording as well as his meaning. Sāti asserts emphatic identity using doubled demonstrative pronouns conjoined with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>(e)va</i> (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tadevidaṁ</i>), and identical constructions are found throughout the Bṛhadāraṇyaka chapter: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sa vā ayam</i> (4.4.5), <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sa vā eṣa</i> (4.4.22, 4.4.24, 4.4.25); see also <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tameva</i> (4.4.17). For <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anaññaṁ</i> we find the inverse <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anya</i> for the “other” body (4.4.3, 4.4.4). For the Pali verbs <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sandhāvati saṁsarati</i> we have instead <i lang='pi' translate='no'>avakrāmati</i> (4.4.1, 4.4.2). But the connection with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁsarati</i> is made in the Brahmanical tradition itself, for it says below, “That self is indeed divinity, made of consciousness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sa vā ayamātmā brahma vijñānamayo</i>; 4.4.5, see too 4.4.22), which the commentator Śaṅkara explains as “the transmigrating self” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁsaratyātmā</i>).
