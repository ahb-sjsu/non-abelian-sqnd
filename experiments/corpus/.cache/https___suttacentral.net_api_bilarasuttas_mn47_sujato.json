{"comment_text": {"mn47:1.1": "In this sutta, the Buddha shows his commitment to radical accountability and integrity.

By extension, this approach may be applied to any spiritual teacher. ", "mn47:2.1": "The ability to comprehend the mind of another was considered an advanced meditative skill, not accessible even to all arahants.

The commentary explains that one has become stilled (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>uparata</i>) due to the absence of perils (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhaya</i>). The test aims to distinguish the arahant from those for whom the perils of defilements and rebirth, though possibly suppressed for a time through the power of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, are still present. ", "mn47:10.6": "The commentary explains <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sugata</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>duggata</i> here as “well practiced” and “poorly practiced”. But the normal sense is one who is in a “good state” or a “sorry state”, typically associated with rebirth, but also with, for example, the “sorry state” of poverty or reduced circumstances (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd10/en/sujato#2.4.4'>Kd 10:2.4.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/sujato#15.5.10'>Kd 6:15.5.10</a>).

However the early Abhidhamma text Puggalapaññatti explains that “insecurely stilled” includes the seven trainees and ethical ordinary people, while the arahant is “securely stilled” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pp2.1/en/sujato#11.1'>Pp 2.1:11.1</a>). Since the Puggalapaññatti consists mainly of lightly adapted quotes from the suttas, it is possible that this passage has been lost from the suttas as they stand.

It is an Upaniṣadic turn of phrase. | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Tammaya</i> (“determined by that”, literally “made with that”) is found occasionally in the suttas (also <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn137/en/sujato#20.3'>MN 137:20.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn113/en/sujato#21.7'>MN 113:21.7</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.40/en/sujato#7.4'>AN 3.40:7.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.104/en/sujato'>AN 6.104</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp4.9/en/sujato#12.2'>Snp 4.9:12.2</a>).

It goes on to list many other items of which the self is comprised (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>idaṁmayo</i>), the point being that the self is ultimately created by its actions (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>yathākārī yathācārī tathā bhavati</i>), a detail that emphasizes the causal sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-maya</i>. Thus the term does not simply point to that which is the self, but rather that by which the self is shaped or determined. Yajñavalkya also uses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>etanmaya</i> in the same sense in such passages as Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.4.2.30: “that (self) is made with hymns, sacrifices, breaths, and divinities” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>candomaya stomamayaḥ prāṇamayo devatāmayaḥ sa etanmaya</i>) and Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.5.3: “that self is made with this: speech, mind, and breath” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>etanmayo vā ayam ātmā: vāṅmayo manomayaḥ prāṇamayaḥ</i>).
