{"comment_text": {"mn4:2.1": "We meet Jānussoṇi many times in the suttas, where he converses with the Buddha on a number of topics, with a special interest in the afterlife. His name appears in Sanskrit as Jānaśruti or Jānaśruteya, which are patronymics of Janaśruti, “famed among the people”, with the element <i lang='pi' translate='no'>soṇi</i> coming from the Vedic <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ṣvaṇi</i> (“sound”). The Chinese rendering <span lang='lzh'>生聞</span> (“Born Famous”, T 125.2.665b18) evidently assumes the same derivation (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>jana</i> “people” is from √<i lang='pi' translate='no'>jan</i> “born”). The Pali commentary says it is a title awarded the family priest (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>purohita</i>) of Kosala, which would make him one of the most powerful brahmins alive. However, I can find no confirmation of such a title, whereas the use of Jānaśruti as a patronymic by the descendants of Janaśruti is well attested. One such, perhaps the same individual we meet in the Suttas, features in Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4.1–3 as a generous seeker of the truth.
