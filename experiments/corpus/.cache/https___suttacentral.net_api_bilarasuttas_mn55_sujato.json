His story is told in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/sujato'>Kd 8</a>, where we learn that he was abandoned on a trash heap by his mother Sālavatī, only to be discovered and raised by Prince Abhaya of Magadha, a Jain <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn58/en/sujato'>MN 58</a>. He was called “Survivior” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>jīvaka</i>) and “Raised by a Prince” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>komārabhacca</i>). In later Ayurveda, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kaumārabhṛtya</i> means “paediatrics”, and a lost treatise on that subject is attributed to Jīvaka (Jīvakatantra).

They objected only to eating meat “killed on purpose for him”, and so by implication not all eating of meat. This is consistent with several Jain scriptural passages indicating that ascetics may, under certain strictures, eat meat (Ācaraṅgasūtra 2.1.10.5–6, Bhagavatīsūtra 557 (p. 1261a), Kalpasūtra (Sāmācārī 17), Dasaveyāliyasutta 5–1.73).

To allay suspicion of improper meat, mendicants are also required to check the provenance of meat before eating (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/sujato#23.9.9'>Kd 6:23.9.9</a>).
