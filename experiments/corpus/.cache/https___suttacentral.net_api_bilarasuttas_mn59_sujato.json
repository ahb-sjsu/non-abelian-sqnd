As <i lang='pi' translate='no'>thapati</i> (“chamberlain”) he was the ranking official under Pasenadi. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.17–18 tells us that royal authority goes from the king, to the king’s brother, to the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>thapati</i>, to the village head. Similarly, Atharva Veda 2.32.4a and 5.23.11a mention the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>thapati</i> directly after the king. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn55.6/en/sujato#15.1'>SN 55.6:15.1</a> shows the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>thapati</i> was trusted with the most intimate and sensitive duties of the court. Elsewhere we learn that they shared the meal and carriage with the king, accompanying him on military campaigns (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn89/en/sujato#18.1'>MN 89:18.1</a>), while <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn55.6/en/sujato#1.4'>SN 55.6:1.4</a> shows them engaged in governing the provinces. Thus the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>thapati</i> was the highest non-royal official in the court, entrusted with governing, advising, and security of the household. | There are several individuals called Udāyī, and it is not possible to distinguish them all.
