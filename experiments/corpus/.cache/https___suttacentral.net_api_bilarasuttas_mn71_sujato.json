{"comment_text": {"mn71:1.1": "This begins the “Vacchagotta trilogy”, a series of three suttas tracing Vacchagotta’s spiritual development. These are supplemented by an entire Saṁyutta of questions (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn33/en/sujato'>SN 33</a>). In this sutta he shows an attitude of curiosity and respect, and gains a degree of faith in the Buddha. | This is not the same person as the lay brahmin Vacchagotta of Venāgapura  at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.63/en/sujato#2.1'>AN 3.63:2.1</a>. ", "mn71:2.1": "Vacchagotta is a clan name; his personal name is not recorded. The Vaccha clan stems from the Vedic seer Vatsa, author of Rig Veda 8.6–11. Several notable figures of this clan are known, including a lineage master in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.3, but there is nothing to identify them with the Vacchagotta of the suttas. Given Vacchagotta’s evident interest in the ascetic traditions, it is noteworthy that a certain Śayyambha Vatsagotra, father of Manaka, was said to be a direct disciple of Mahāvīra (Kalpasūtra 10.3). ", "mn71:5.1": "At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.57/en/sujato'>AN 3.57</a> he similarly asks the Buddha to confirm his teachings on generosity.

", "mn71:5.2": "Such extraordinary claims were not unprecedented, as both the Jain leader Mahāvīra (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#17.2'>MN 14:17.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn79/en/sujato#6.7'>MN 79:6.7</a>) and Pūraṇa Kassapa (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an9.38/en/sujato#2.1'>AN 9.38:2.1</a>) are said to claim omniscience in the Pali canon. Extant Jain texts have no shortage of such claims (eg. Sūyagaḍa1.6, Kalpasūtra 1, Bhagavatisūtra 4.10, etc.), and it seems likely that this was part of Mahāvīra’s teachings. Sources for Pūraṇa Kassapa are slim, but he was regarded as a great teacher of the Ājīvakas, whose founder the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla was said to be omniscient (Basham, <em>History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas</em>, 275–6).

In the curious dialogue at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn90/en/sujato#8.5'>MN 90:8.5</a> the Buddha denies that anyone “will know” all things simultaneously. The Milindapañha reversed this to the positive statement that the Buddha could know all things, just not simultaneously (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.2/en/sujato#1.2'>Mil 5.1.2:1.2</a>).
