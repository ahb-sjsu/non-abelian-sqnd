God divided the light from the darkness.\nGod called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first day.\nGod said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”\nGod made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.\nGod called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.\nGod said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so.\nGod called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”.

He also made the stars.\nGod set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth,\nand to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.\nThere was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\nGod said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.”\nGod created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.\nGod blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”\nThere was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\nGod said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind”; and it was so.\nGod made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.\nGod said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”\nGod created man in his own image.

    "text_original": "The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,\nand he said, “See now, my lords, please come into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.”\nThey said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”\nHe urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.\nBut before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.\nThey called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.”\nLot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.\nHe said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly.\nSee now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.”\nThey said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break the door.\nBut the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.\nThey struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\nThe men said to Lot, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:\nfor we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.”\nLot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city.”\nBut he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.\nWhen the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.”\nBut he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.\nIt came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!”\nLot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord.\nSee now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.\nSee now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.”\nHe said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.\nHurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\nThe sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.\nThen Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.\nHe overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.\nBut his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\nAbraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.\nHe looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.\nWhen God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.\nLot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.\nThe firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.\nCome, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”\nThey made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.\nIt came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father.

The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up.\nThus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father.\nThe firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab.

    "text_english": "The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,\nand he said, “See now, my lords, please come into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.”\nThey said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”\nHe urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.\nBut before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.\nThey called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.”\nLot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.\nHe said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly.\nSee now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.”\nThey said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break the door.\nBut the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.\nThey struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\nThe men said to Lot, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:\nfor we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.”\nLot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city.”\nBut he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.\nWhen the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.”\nBut he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.\nIt came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!”\nLot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord.\nSee now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.\nSee now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.”\nHe said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.\nHurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\nThe sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.\nThen Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.\nHe overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.\nBut his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\nAbraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.\nHe looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.\nWhen God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.\nLot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.\nThe firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.\nCome, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”\nThey made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.\nIt came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”\nThey made their father drink wine that night also.

Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,\n“No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.”\nAbraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.\nHe spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.”\nEphron answered Abraham, saying to him,\n“My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.”\nAbraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard.\nSo the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded\nto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.\nAfter this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.\nThe field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham by the children of Heth as a possession for a burial place.\n",

Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.\nAbraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh.\nI will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.\nBut you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”\nThe servant said to him, “What if the woman isn’t willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?”\nAbraham said to him, “Beware that you don’t bring my son there again.\nYahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give this land to your offspring. He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.\nIf the woman isn’t willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath to me. Only you shall not bring my son there again.”\nThe servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.\nThe servant took ten camels, of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.\nHe made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.\nHe said, “Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.\nBehold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.\nLet it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,’ and she will say, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,’—let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”\nBefore he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.\nThe young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up.\nThe servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.”\nShe said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him a drink.\nWhen she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have finished drinking.”\nShe hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.\nThe man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not.\nAs the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,\nand said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay?”\nShe said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”\nShe said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in.”\nThe man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh.\nHe said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.”\nThe young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words.\nRebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.\nWhen he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.\nHe said, “Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.”\nThe man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.\nFood was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.”\nHe said, “Speak on.”\nHe said, “I am Abraham’s servant.\nYahweh has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.\nSarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him.\nMy master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,\nbut you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’\nI asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’\nHe said to me, ‘Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of my father’s house.\nThen will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’\nI came today to the spring, and said, ‘Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go—\nbehold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,”\nand she will tell me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master’s son.’\nBefore I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’\nShe hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.\nI asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.\nI bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.\nNow if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.”\nThen Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can’t speak to you bad or good.\nBehold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as Yahweh has spoken.”\nWhen Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh.\nThe servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother.\nThey ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”\nHer brother and her mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go.”\nHe said to them, “Don’t hinder me, since Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.”\nThey said, “We will call the young lady, and ask her.”\nThey called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?”\nShe said, “I will go.”\nThey sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham’s servant, and his men.\nThey blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them.”\nRebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way.\nIsaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South.\nIsaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes and looked. Behold, there were camels coming.\nRebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she got off the camel.\nShe said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?”\nThe servant said, “It is my master.”\nShe took her veil, and covered herself.\nThe servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.\nIsaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife.

    "text_original": "There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.\nYahweh appeared to him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.\nLive in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.\nI will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring. In your offspring will all the nations of the earth be blessed,\nbecause Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”\nIsaac lived in Gerar.\nThe men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.”\nWhen he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.\nAbimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’”\nIsaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”\nAbimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”\nAbimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”\nIsaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. Yahweh blessed him.\nThe man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.\nHe had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.\nNow all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.\nAbimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”\nIsaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.\nIsaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham.

    "text_english": "There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.\nYahweh appeared to him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.\nLive in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.\nI will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring. In your offspring will all the nations of the earth be blessed,\nbecause Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”\nIsaac lived in Gerar.\nThe men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.”\nWhen he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.\nAbimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’”\nIsaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”\nAbimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”\nAbimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”\nIsaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. Yahweh blessed him.\nThe man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.\nHe had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.\nNow all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.\nAbimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”\nIsaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.\nIsaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them.\nIsaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.\nThe herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.\nThey dug another well, and they argued over that, also.

Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\nRebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,\n‘Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.’\nNow therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.\nGo now to the flock and get me two good young goats from there. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves.\nYou shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”\nJacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.\nWhat if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.”\nHis mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.”\nHe went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved.\nRebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.\nShe put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.\nShe gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\nHe came to his father, and said, “My father?”\nHe said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”\nJacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.”\nIsaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?”\nHe said, “Because Yahweh your God gave me success.”\nIsaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.”\nJacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”\nHe didn’t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau’s hands. So he blessed him.\nHe said, “Are you really my son Esau?”\nHe said, “I am.”\nHe said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you.”\nHe brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.\nHis father Isaac said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.”\nHe came near, and kissed him.

He said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.”\nIsaac his father said to him, “Who are you?”\nHe said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”\nIsaac trembled violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.”\nWhen Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my father.”\nHe said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.”\nHe said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?”\nIsaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?”\nEsau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father?

They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well’s mouth in its place.\nJacob said to them, “My relatives, where are you from?”\nThey said, “We are from Haran.”\nHe said to them, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?”\nThey said, “We know him.”\nHe said to them, “Is it well with him?”\nThey said, “It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.”\nHe said, “Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.”\nThey said, “We can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we water the sheep.”\nWhile he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them.\nWhen Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.\nJacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\nJacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father.\nWhen Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.\nLaban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” He stayed with him for a month.\nLaban said to Jacob, “Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?”\nLaban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\nLeah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.\nJacob loved Rachel. He said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.”\nLaban said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.”\nJacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.\nJacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.”\nLaban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.\nIn the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her.\nLaban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant.\nIn the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”\nLaban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.\nFulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years.”\nJacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.\nLaban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his servant, to be her servant.\nHe went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\nYahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.\nLeah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, “Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction; for now my husband will love me.”\nShe conceived again, and bore a son, and said, “Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.” She named him Simeon.\nShe conceived again, and bore a son. Said, “Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi.\nShe conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “This time will I praise Yahweh.” Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.\n",

If he said this, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked.\nThus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me.\nDuring mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.\nThe angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’\nHe said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.\nI am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me.

For he has sold us, and has also used up our money.\nFor all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.”\nThen Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,\nand he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.\nNow Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim\n that were her father’s.\nJacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away.\nSo he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.\nLaban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.\nHe took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.\nGod came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.”\nLaban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.\nLaban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?\nWhy did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;\nand didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.\nIt is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.’\nNow, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my gods?”\nJacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.’\nAnyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them.\nLaban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn’t find them.

Jacob answered Laban, “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?\nNow that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.\n“These twenty years I have been with you.

Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.\nThis was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.\nThese twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.\nUnless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”\nLaban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?\nNow come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you.”\nJacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\nJacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap.

Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.\nYahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.\nHis master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand.\nJoseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.\nFrom the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake. Yahweh’s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.\nHe left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.\nJoseph was well-built and handsome.\nAfter these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.”\nBut he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.\nNo one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife.

It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.\nJoseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?”\nThey said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”\nJoseph recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him.\nJoseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.”\nThey said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.\nWe are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.”\nHe said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”\nThey said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.”\nJoseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’\nBy this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here.\nSend one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.”\nHe put them all together into custody for three days.\nJoseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God.\nIf you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.\nBring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.”\nThey did so.\nThey said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.”\nReuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen?

Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.\nThen Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.\nThey loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.\nAs one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.\nHe said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”\nThey came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,\n“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.\nWe said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies.\nWe are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’\nThe man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.\nBring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’”\nAs they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.\nJacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.”\nReuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.”\nHe said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left.

Your servants are not spies.”\nHe said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”\nThey said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.”\nJoseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’\nBy this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here.\nSend one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.”\nHe put them all together into custody for three days.\nJoseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God.\nIf you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.\nBring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.”\nThey did so.\nThey said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.”\nReuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.”\nThey didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.\nHe turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.\nThen Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.\nThey loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.\nAs one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.\nHe said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”\nThey came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,\n“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.\nWe said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies.\nWe are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’\nThe man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.\nBring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’”\nAs they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.\nJacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.”\nReuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.”\nHe said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”\n",

We have brought it back in our hand.\nWe have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in our sacks.”\nHe said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid.

You shall plunder the Egyptians.”\n",

Behold, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river’s bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand.\nYou shall tell him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, “Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness:” and behold, until now you haven’t listened.\nYahweh says, “In this you shall know that I am Yahweh. Behold, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.\nThe fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.”’”\nYahweh said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’”\nMoses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.\nThe fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians couldn’t drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.\nThe magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.\nPharaoh turned and went into his house, and he didn’t even take this to heart.\nAll the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink; for they couldn’t drink the river water.\nSeven days were fulfilled, after Yahweh had struck the river.\n",

In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.’”\nThen Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, “Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover.\nYou shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two door posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.\nFor Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two door posts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you.\nYou shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever.\nIt shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service.\nIt will happen, when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’\nthat you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of Yahweh’s Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.’”\nThe people bowed their heads and worshiped.\nThe children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.\nAt midnight, Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of livestock.\nPharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.\nHe called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!\nTake both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!”\nThe Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We are all dead men.”\nThe people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.\nThe children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing.\nYahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. They plundered the Egyptians.\nThe children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.\nA mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock.\nThey baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn’t leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn’t wait, and they had not prepared any food for themselves.\nNow the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.\nAt the end of four hundred thirty years, to the day, all of Yahweh’s armies went out from the land of Egypt.\nIt is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Yahweh, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.\nYahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner shall eat of it,\nbut every man’s servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.\nA foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.\nIt must be eaten in one house. You shall not carry any of the meat outside of the house. Do not break any of its bones.\nAll the congregation of Israel shall keep it.\nWhen a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.\nOne law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you.”\nAll the children of Israel did so. As Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.\nThat same day, Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.\n",

Speak to them, saying, ‘At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread: and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God.’”\nIn the evening, quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.\nWhen the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.\nWhen the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they didn’t know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat.”\nThis is the thing which Yahweh has commanded: “Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.”\nThe children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.\nWhen they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered every man according to his eating.\nMoses said to them, “Let no one leave of it until the morning.”\nNotwithstanding they didn’t listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them.\nThey gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted.\nOn the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.\nHe said to them, “This is that which Yahweh has spoken, ‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’”\nThey laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it didn’t become foul, and there were no worms in it.\nMoses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in the field.\nSix days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none.”\nOn the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.\nYahweh said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?\nBehold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.”\nSo the people rested on the seventh day.\nThe house of Israel called its name Manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.\nMoses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, ‘Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”\nMoses said to Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations.”\nAs Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.\nThe children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.\nNow an omer is one tenth of an ephah.\n",

Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”\nWhen Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.”\nThey rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.\nYahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!\nThey have turned away quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’”\nYahweh said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.\nNow therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.”\nMoses begged Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?\nWhy should the Egyptians speak, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.\nRemember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’”\nYahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.\nMoses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written.\nThe tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.\nWhen Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the noise of war in the camp.”\nHe said, “It isn’t the voice of those who shout for victory. It is not the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear.”\nAs soon as he came near to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Then Moses’ anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.\nHe took the calf which they had made, and burned it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink it.\nMoses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?”\nAaron said, “Don’t let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.\nFor they said to me, ‘Make us gods, which shall go before us.

    "text_english": "When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.”\nAaron said to them, “Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.”\nAll the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.\nHe received what they handed him, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten calf. Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”\nWhen Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.”\nThey rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.\nYahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!\nThey have turned away quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’”\nYahweh said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.\nNow therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.”\nMoses begged Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?\nWhy should the Egyptians speak, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.\nRemember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’”\nYahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.\nMoses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written.\nThe tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.\nWhen Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the noise of war in the camp.”\nHe said, “It isn’t the voice of those who shout for victory. It is not the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear.”\nAs soon as he came near to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Then Moses’ anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.\nHe took the calf which they had made, and burned it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink it.\nMoses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?”\nAaron said, “Don’t let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.\nFor they said to me, ‘Make us gods, which shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.’\nI said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:’ so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”\nWhen Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies),\nthen Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on Yahweh’s side, come to me!”\nAll the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.\nHe said to them, “Yahweh says, the God of Israel, ‘Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.’”\nThe sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\nMoses said, “Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may give you a blessing today.”\nOn the next day, Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin.

Whoever eats it shall be cut off.”\n“‘Every person that eats what dies of itself, or that which is torn by animals, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening: then he shall be clean.\nBut if he doesn’t wash them, or bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.’”\n",

Go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their offspring after them.’”\nI spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone.\nYahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the sky for multitude.\nYahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!\nHow can I myself alone bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife?\nTake wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.”\nYou answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.”\nSo I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.\nI commanded your judges at that time, saying, “Hear cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.\nYou shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.”\nI commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.\nWe traveled from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.\nI said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.\nBehold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you. Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.”\nYou came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.”\nThe thing pleased me well. I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe.\nThey turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.\nThey took some of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.”\nYet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God.\nYou murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.\nWhere are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’”\nThen I said to you, “Don’t dread, neither be afraid of them.\nYahweh your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,\nand in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.”\nYet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your God,\nwho went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.\nYahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,\n“Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,\nexcept Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on to him, and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.”\nAlso Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there.\nJoshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.\nMoreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give it to them, and they shall possess it.\nBut as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”\nThen you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh, we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.\nYahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.’”\nSo I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.\nThe Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.\nYou returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn’t listen to your voice, nor turn his ear to you.\nSo you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.\n",

Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’”\nThen I said to you, “Don’t dread, neither be afraid of them.\nYahweh your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,\nand in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.”\nYet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your God,\nwho went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.\nYahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,\n“Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,\nexcept Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on to him, and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.”\nAlso Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there.\nJoshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.\nMoreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give it to them, and they shall possess it.\nBut as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”\nThen you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh, we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.\nYahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.’”\nSo I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.\nThe Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.\nYou returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn’t listen to your voice, nor turn his ear to you.\nSo you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.\n",

The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.\nYahweh spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice.\nHe declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets.\nYahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.\nBe very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire,\nlest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,\nthe likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,\nthe likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;\nand lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky.\nBut Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as it is today.\nFurthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance;\nbut I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go over, and possess that good land.\nBe careful, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he made with you, and make yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.\nFor Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.\nWhen you shall father children, and children’s children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a carved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in Yahweh your God’s sight, to provoke him to anger;\nI call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan to possess it. You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed.\nYahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh will lead you away.\nThere you shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.\nBut from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.\nWhen you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God, and listen to his voice.\nFor Yahweh your God is a merciful God. He will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.\nFor ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?\nDid a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?\nOr has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from among another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?\nIt was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is God. There is no one else besides him.\nOut of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.\nBecause he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;\nto drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today.\nKnow therefore today, and take it to heart, that Yahweh himself is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath.

The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.\nYahweh spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice.\nHe declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets.\nYahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.\nBe very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire,\nlest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,\nthe likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,\nthe likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;\nand lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky.\nBut Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as it is today.\nFurthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance;\nbut I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go over, and possess that good land.\nBe careful, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he made with you, and make yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.\nFor Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.\nWhen you shall father children, and children’s children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a carved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in Yahweh your God’s sight, to provoke him to anger;\nI call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan to possess it. You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed.\nYahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh will lead you away.\nThere you shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.\nBut from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.\nWhen you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God, and listen to his voice.\nFor Yahweh your God is a merciful God. He will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.\nFor ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?\nDid a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?\nOr has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from among another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?\nIt was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is God. There is no one else besides him.\nOut of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.\nBecause he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;\nto drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today.\nKnow therefore today, and take it to heart, that Yahweh himself is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no one else.\nYou shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you today, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.\nThen Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;\nthat the man slayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and didn’t hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:\nBezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.\nThis is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.\nThese are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt,\nbeyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they came out of Egypt.\nThey took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;\nfrom Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (also called Hermon),\nand all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.\n",

You may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.\nBut Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they are destroyed.\nHe will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under the sky. No one will be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.\nYou shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God.\nYou shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.\n",

I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.\nIt shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.\nBut the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.”\nYou may say in your heart, “How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?”\nWhen a prophet speaks in Yahweh’s name, if the thing doesn’t follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him.\n",

through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”\nYahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,\n“Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession.\nDie on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people;\nbecause you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn’t uphold my holiness among the children of Israel.\nFor you shall see the land from a distance; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel.”\n",

established a testimony in Jacob,\nand appointed a teaching in Israel,\nwhich he commanded our fathers,\nthat they should make them known to their children;\nthat the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;\nwho should arise and tell their children,\nthat they might set their hope in God,\nand not forget God’s deeds,\nbut keep his commandments,\nand might not be as their fathers,\na stubborn and rebellious generation,\na generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,\nwhose spirit was not steadfast with God.\nThe children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,\nturned back in the day of battle.\nThey didn’t keep God’s covenant,\nand refused to walk in his law.\nThey forgot his doings,\nhis wondrous deeds that he had shown them.\nHe did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,\nin the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.\nHe split the sea, and caused them to pass through.\nHe made the waters stand as a heap.\nIn the daytime he also led them with a cloud,\nand all night with a light of fire.\nHe split rocks in the wilderness,\nand gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.\nHe brought streams also out of the rock,\nand caused waters to run down like rivers.\nYet they still went on to sin against him,\nto rebel against the Most High in the desert.\nThey tempted God in their heart\nby asking food according to their desire.\nYes, they spoke against God.\nThey said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?\nBehold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,\nand streams overflowed.\nCan he give bread also?\nWill he provide meat for his people?”\nTherefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.\nA fire was kindled against Jacob,\nanger also went up against Israel,\nbecause they didn’t believe in God,\nand didn’t trust in his salvation.\nYet he commanded the skies above,\nand opened the doors of heaven.\nHe rained down manna on them to eat,\nand gave them food from the sky.\nMan ate the bread of angels.\nHe sent them food to the full.\nHe caused the east wind to blow in the sky.\nBy his power he guided the south wind.\nHe rained also meat on them as the dust;\nwinged birds as the sand of the seas.\nHe let them fall in the middle of their camp,\naround their habitations.\nSo they ate, and were well filled.\nHe gave them their own desire.\nThey didn’t turn from their cravings.\nTheir food was yet in their mouths,\nwhen the anger of God went up against them,\nkilled some of their fattest,\nand struck down the young men of Israel.\nFor all this they still sinned,\nand didn’t believe in his wondrous works.\nTherefore he consumed their days in vanity,\nand their years in terror.\nWhen he killed them, then they inquired after him.\nThey returned and sought God earnestly.\nThey remembered that God was their rock,\nthe Most High God, their redeemer.\nBut they flattered him with their mouth,\nand lied to him with their tongue.\nFor their heart was not right with him,\nneither were they faithful in his covenant.\nBut he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.\nYes, many times he turned his anger away,\nand didn’t stir up all his wrath.\nHe remembered that they were but flesh,\na wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.\nHow often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,\nand grieved him in the desert!\nThey turned again and tempted God,\nand provoked the Holy One of Israel.\nThey didn’t remember his hand,\nnor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;\nhow he set his signs in Egypt,\nhis wonders in the field of Zoan,\nhe turned their rivers into blood,\nand their streams, so that they could not drink.\nHe sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;\nand frogs, which destroyed them.\nHe gave also their increase to the caterpillar,\nand their labor to the locust.\nHe destroyed their vines with hail,\ntheir sycamore fig trees with frost.\nHe gave over their livestock also to the hail,\nand their flocks to hot thunderbolts.\nHe threw on them the fierceness of his anger,\nwrath, indignation, and trouble,\nand a band of angels of evil.\nHe made a path for his anger.\nHe didn’t spare their soul from death,\nbut gave their life over to the pestilence,\nand struck all the firstborn in Egypt,\nthe chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.\nBut he led out his own people like sheep,\nand guided them in the wilderness like a flock.\nHe led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,\nbut the sea overwhelmed their enemies.\nHe brought them to the border of his sanctuary,\nto this mountain, which his right hand had taken.\nHe also drove out the nations before them,\nallotted them for an inheritance by line,\nand made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.\nYet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,\nand didn’t keep his testimonies;\nbut turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.\nThey were twisted like a deceitful bow.\nFor they provoked him to anger with their high places,\nand moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.\nWhen God heard this, he was angry,\nand greatly abhorred Israel;\nSo that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,\nthe tent which he placed among men;\nand delivered his strength into captivity,\nhis glory into the adversary’s hand.\nHe also gave his people over to the sword,\nand was angry with his inheritance.\nFire devoured their young men.\nTheir virgins had no wedding song.\nTheir priests fell by the sword,\nand their widows couldn’t weep.\nThen the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,\nlike a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.\nHe struck his adversaries backward.\nHe put them to a perpetual reproach.\nMoreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,\nand didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,\nBut chose the tribe of Judah,\nMount Zion which he loved.\nHe built his sanctuary like the heights,\nlike the earth which he has established forever.\nHe also chose David his servant,\nand took him from the sheepfolds;\nfrom following the ewes that have their young,\nhe brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,\nand Israel, his inheritance.\nSo he was their shepherd according

seas.\nHe let them fall in the middle of their camp,\naround their habitations.\nSo they ate, and were well filled.\nHe gave them their own desire.\nThey didn’t turn from their cravings.\nTheir food was yet in their mouths,\nwhen the anger of God went up against them,\nkilled some of their fattest,\nand struck down the young men of Israel.\nFor all this they still sinned,\nand didn’t believe in his wondrous works.\nTherefore he consumed their days in vanity,\nand their years in terror.\nWhen he killed them, then they inquired after him.\nThey returned and sought God earnestly.\nThey remembered that God was their rock,\nthe Most High God, their redeemer.\nBut they flattered him with their mouth,\nand lied to him with their tongue.\nFor their heart was not right with him,\nneither were they faithful in his covenant.\nBut he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.\nYes, many times he turned his anger away,\nand didn’t stir up all his wrath.\nHe remembered that they were but flesh,\na wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.\nHow often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,\nand grieved him in the desert!\nThey turned again and tempted God,\nand provoked the Holy One of Israel.\nThey didn’t remember his hand,\nnor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;\nhow he set his signs in Egypt,\nhis wonders in the field of Zoan,\nhe turned their rivers into blood,\nand their streams, so that they could not drink.\nHe sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;\nand frogs, which destroyed them.\nHe gave also their increase to the caterpillar,\nand their labor to the locust.\nHe destroyed their vines with hail,\ntheir sycamore fig trees with frost.\nHe gave over their livestock also to the hail,\nand their flocks to hot thunderbolts.\nHe threw on them the fierceness of his anger,\nwrath, indignation, and trouble,\nand a band of angels of evil.\nHe made a path for his anger.\nHe didn’t spare their soul from death,\nbut gave their life over to the pestilence,\nand struck all the firstborn in Egypt,\nthe chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.\nBut he led out his own people like sheep,\nand guided them in the wilderness like a flock.\nHe led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,\nbut the sea overwhelmed their enemies.\nHe brought them to the border of his sanctuary,\nto this mountain, which his right hand had taken.\nHe also drove out the nations before them,\nallotted them for an inheritance by line,\nand made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.\nYet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,\nand didn’t keep his testimonies;\nbut turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.\nThey were twisted like a deceitful bow.\nFor they provoked him to anger with their high places,\nand moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.\nWhen God heard this, he was angry,\nand greatly abhorred Israel;\nSo that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,\nthe tent which he placed among men;\nand delivered his strength into captivity,\nhis glory into the adversary’s hand.\nHe also gave his people over to the sword,\nand was angry with his inheritance.\nFire devoured their young men.\nTheir virgins had no wedding song.\nTheir priests fell by the sword,\nand their widows couldn’t weep.\nThen the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,\nlike a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.\nHe struck his adversaries backward.\nHe put them to a perpetual reproach.\nMoreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,\nand didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,\nBut chose the tribe of Judah,\nMount Zion which he loved.\nHe built his sanctuary like the heights,\nlike the earth which he has established forever.\nHe also chose David his servant,\nand took him from the sheepfolds;\nfrom following the ewes that have their young,\nhe brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,\nand Israel, his inheritance.\nSo he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,\nand guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.\n",

    "text_english": "Yahweh said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen, ‘For Maher Shalal Hash Baz’;\nand I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.”\nI went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Yahweh said to me, “Call his name ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’\nFor before the child knows how to say, ‘My father,’ and, ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.”\nYahweh spoke to me yet again, saying,\n“Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;\nnow therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River: the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.\nIt will sweep onward into Judah. It will overflow and pass through; it will reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the width of your land, Immanuel.\nMake an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be shattered!\nTake counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand: for God is with us.”\nFor Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,\n“Don’t say, ‘A conspiracy!’ concerning all about which this people say, ‘A conspiracy!’ neither fear their threats, nor be terrorized.\nYahweh of Armies is who you must respect as holy. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread.\nHe will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\nMany will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured.”\nWrap up the testimony. Seal the law among my disciples.\nI will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.\nBehold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies, who dwells in Mount Zion.\nWhen they tell you, “Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter:” shouldn’t a people consult with their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?\nTurn to the law and to the testimony! If they don’t speak according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.\nThey will pass through it, very distressed and hungry; and it will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by their God. They will turn their faces upward,\nand look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into thick darkness.\n",

They will ponder you, saying, “Is this the man who made the earth to tremble, who shook kingdoms;\nwho made the world like a wilderness, and overthrew its cities; who didn’t release his prisoners to their home?”\nAll the kings of the nations, sleep in glory, everyone in his own house.\nBut you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead body trodden under foot.\nYou will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed your land. You have killed your people. The offspring of evildoers will not be named forever.\nPrepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their fathers, that they not rise up and possess the earth, and fill the surface of the world with cities.\n“I will rise up against them,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son’s son,” says Yahweh.\n“I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water. I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” says Yahweh of Armies.\nYahweh of Armies has sworn, saying, “Surely, as I have thought, so shall it happen; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:\nthat I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him under foot on my mountains. Then his yoke will leave them, and his burden leave their shoulders.\nThis is the plan that is determined for the whole earth. This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.\nFor Yahweh of Armies has planned, and who can stop it? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?”\nThis burden was in the year that king Ahaz died.\nDon’t rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that struck you is broken; for out of the serpent’s root an adder will emerge, and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent.\nThe firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant will be killed.\nHowl, gate! Cry, city! You are melted away, Philistia, all of you; for smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.\nWhat will they answer the messengers of the nation? That Yahweh has founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of his people will take refuge.\n",

Let him declare what he sees.\nWhen he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.”\nHe cried like a lion: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.\nBehold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.\nYou are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!” That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.\nThe burden of Dumah.\nOne calls to me out of Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?”\nThe watchman said, “The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back again.”\nThe burden on Arabia.\nIn the forest in Arabia you will lodge, you caravans of Dedanites.\nThey brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.\nFor they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.\nFor the Lord said to me, “Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,\nand the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.”\n",

When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.”\nThey, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.\nWhen they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.\nThey came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.\nBeing warned in a dream that they shouldn’t return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.\nNow when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.”\nHe arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,\nand was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”\nThen Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men.\nThen that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,\n“A voice was heard in Ramah,\nlamentation, weeping and great mourning,\nRachel weeping for her children;\nshe wouldn’t be comforted,\nbecause they are no more.”\nBut when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,\n“Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child’s life are dead.”\nHe arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.\nBut when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee,\nand came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”\n",

His food was locusts and wild honey.\nThen people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him.\nThey were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.\nBut when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\nTherefore produce fruit worthy of repentance!\nDon’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.\n“Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees.

Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.\n\n\nBut when you do merciful deeds, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand does,\n\n\nso that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.\n\n“When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.\n\n\nBut you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.\n\n\nIn praying, don’t use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.\n\n\nTherefore don’t be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him.\n\n\nPray like this: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.\n\n\nLet your Kingdom come.

For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.\n\n\nBut you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;\n\n\nso that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.\n\n\n“Don’t lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;\n\n\nbut lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don’t break through and steal;\n\n\nfor where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n\n\n“The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.\n\n\nBut if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!\n\n\n“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can’t serve both God and Mammon.\n\n\nTherefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food, and the body more than clothing?\n\n\nSee the birds of the sky, that they don’t sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you of much more value than they?\n\n“Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment\nto his lifespan?\n\n\nWhy are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin,\n\n\nyet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.\n\n\nBut if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith?\n\n“Therefore don’t be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’, ‘What will we drink?’ or, ‘With what will we be clothed?’\n\n\nFor the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.\n\n\nBut seek first God’s Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.\n\n\nTherefore don’t be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.\n\n\nBut when you do merciful deeds, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand does,\n\n\nso that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.\n\n“When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.\n\n\nBut you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.\n\n\nIn praying, don’t use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.\n\n\nTherefore don’t be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him.\n\n\nPray like this: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.\n\n\nLet your Kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.\n\n\nGive us today our daily bread.\n\n\nForgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.\n\n\nBring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.’\n\n“For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.\n\n\nBut if you don’t forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\n\n“Moreover when you fast, don’t be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.\n\n\nBut you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;\n\n\nso that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.\n\n\n“Don’t lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;\n\n\nbut lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don’t break through and steal;\n\n\nfor where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n\n\n“The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.\n\n\nBut if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!\n\n\n“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can’t serve both God and Mammon.\n\n\nTherefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food, and the body more than clothing?\n\n\nSee the birds of the sky, that they don’t sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you of much more value than they?\n\n“Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment\nto his lifespan?\n\n\nWhy are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin,\n\n\nyet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.\n\n\nBut if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith?\n\n“Therefore don’t be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’, ‘What will we drink?’ or, ‘With what will we be clothed?’\n\n\nFor the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.\n\n\nBut seek first God’s Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.\n\n\nTherefore don’t be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day’s own evil is sufficient.\n",

The thorns grew up and choked them.\n\n\nOthers fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.\n\n\nHe who has ears to hear, let him hear.”\nThe disciples came, and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”\nHe answered them,\n“To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.\n\n\nFor whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he has.\n\n\nTherefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don’t see, and hearing, they don’t hear, neither do they understand.\n\n\nIn them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says,\n\n‘By hearing you will hear,\nand will in no way understand;\nSeeing you will see,\nand will in no way perceive:\n\nfor this people’s heart has grown callous,\ntheir ears are dull of hearing,\nthey have closed their eyes;\nor else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes,\nhear with their ears,\nunderstand with their heart,\nand would turn again;\nand I would heal them.’\n\n“But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.\n\n\nFor most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.\n\n“Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.\n\n\nWhen anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.\n\n\nWhat was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;\n\n\nyet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.\n\n\nWhat was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.\n\n\nWhat was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.”\nHe set another parable before them, saying,\n“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,\n\n\nbut while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds\nalso among the wheat, and went away.\n\n\nBut when the blade sprang up and produced fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.\n\n\nThe servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where did these darnel weeds come from?’\n\n“He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’\n“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?’\n\n\n“But he said, ‘No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.\n\n\nLet both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, “First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”\nHe set another parable before them, saying,\n“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;\n\n\nwhich indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.”\nHe spoke another parable to them.\n“The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures\nof meal, until it was all leavened.”\nJesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn’t speak to them,\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,\n“I will open my mouth in parables;\nI will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”\nThen Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field.”\nHe answered them,\n“He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,\n\n\nthe field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one.\n\n\nThe enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.\n\n\nAs therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age.\n\n\nThe Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,\n\n\nand will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n\n\nThen the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.\n\n“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,\n\n\nwho having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\n\n“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,\n\n\nwhich, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.\n\n\nSo will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous,\n\n\nand will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.”\nJesus said to them,\n“Have you understood all these things?”\n\nThey answered him, “Yes, Lord.”\nHe said to them,\n“Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.”\nWhen Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.\nComing into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?\nIsn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?\nAren’t all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?”\nThey were offended by him.\nBut Jesus said to them,\n“A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.”\nHe didn’t do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.\n",

Untie them, and bring them to me.\n\n\nIf anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and immediately he will send them.”\nAll this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,\n“Tell the daughter of Zion,\nbehold, your King comes to you,\nhumble, and riding on a donkey,\non a colt, the foal of a donkey.”\nThe disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,\nand brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.\nA very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.\nThe multitudes who went in front of him, and those who followed, kept shouting, “Hosanna\n to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”\n\nWhen he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”\nThe multitudes said, “This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.”\nJesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.\nHe said to them,\n“It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’\nbut you have made it a den of robbers!”\nThe blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.\nBut when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the son of David!” they were indignant,\nand said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?”\nJesus said to them,\n“Yes. Did you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?’”\nHe left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and camped there.\nNow in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.\nSeeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it,\n“Let there be no fruit from you forever!”\n\nImmediately the fig tree withered away.\nWhen the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither away?”\nJesus answered them,\n“Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don’t doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done.\n\n\nAll things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”\nWhen he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?”\nJesus answered them,\n“I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.\n\n\nThe baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?”\n\nThey reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’\nBut if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.”\nThey answered Jesus, and said, “We don’t know.”\nHe also said to them,\n“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\n\n\nBut what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’\n\n\nHe answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind, and went.\n\n\nHe came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I’ m going, sir,’ but he didn’t go.\n\n\nWhich of the two did the will of his father?”\nThey said to him, “The first.”\nJesus said to them,\n“Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into God’s Kingdom before you.\n\n\nFor John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn’t believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him.

    "text_english": "When they came near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,\nsaying to them,\n“Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them to me.\n\n\nIf anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and immediately he will send them.”\nAll this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,\n“Tell the daughter of Zion,\nbehold, your King comes to you,\nhumble, and riding on a donkey,\non a colt, the foal of a donkey.”\nThe disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,\nand brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.\nA very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.\nThe multitudes who went in front of him, and those who followed, kept shouting, “Hosanna\n to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”\n\nWhen he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”\nThe multitudes said, “This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.”\nJesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.\nHe said to them,\n“It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’\nbut you have made it a den of robbers!”\nThe blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.\nBut when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the son of David!” they were indignant,\nand said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?”\nJesus said to them,\n“Yes. Did you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?’”\nHe left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and camped there.\nNow in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.\nSeeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it,\n“Let there be no fruit from you forever!”\n\nImmediately the fig tree withered away.\nWhen the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither away?”\nJesus answered them,\n“Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don’t doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done.\n\n\nAll things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”\nWhen he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?”\nJesus answered them,\n“I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.\n\n\nThe baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?”\n\nThey reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’\nBut if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.”\nThey answered Jesus, and said, “We don’t know.”\nHe also said to them,\n“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\n\n\nBut what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’\n\n\nHe answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind, and went.\n\n\nHe came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I’ m going, sir,’ but he didn’t go.\n\n\nWhich of the two did the will of his father?”\nThey said to him, “The first.”\nJesus said to them,\n“Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into God’s Kingdom before you.\n\n\nFor John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn’t believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didn’t even repent afterward, that you might believe him.\n\n\n“Hear another parable.

His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.\n But he answered them,\n“You see all of these things, don’t you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down.”\nAs he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?”\nJesus answered them,\n“Be careful that no one leads you astray.\n\n\nFor many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray.\n\n\nYou will hear of wars and rumors of wars.

    "text_original": "When Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,\n\n“You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.”\nThen the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.\nThey took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him.\nBut they said, “Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people.”\nNow when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,\na woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.\nBut when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste?\nFor this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.”\nHowever, knowing this, Jesus said to them,\n“Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good work for me.\n\n\nFor you always have the poor with you; but you don’t always have me.\n\n\nFor in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”\nThen one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,\nand said, “What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?” They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.\nFrom that time he sought opportunity to betray him.\nNow on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”\nHe said,\n“Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.”’”\nThe disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.\nNow when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.\nAs they were eating, he said,\n“Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”\nThey were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?”\nHe answered,\n“He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.\n\n\nThe Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”\nJudas, who betrayed him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?”\nHe said to him,\n“You said it.”\nAs they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said,\n“Take, eat; this is my body.”\nHe took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying,\n“All of you drink it,\n\n\nfor this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.\n\n\nBut I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”\n\nWhen they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\nThen Jesus said to them,\n“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’\n\nBut after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”\n\nBut Peter answered him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”\nPeter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise.\nThen Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples,\n“Sit here, while I go there and pray.”\nHe took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.\nThen he said to them,\n“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me.”\nHe went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying,\n“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”\nHe came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter,\n“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour?\n\n\nWatch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\nAgain, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying,\n“My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.”\n\nHe came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.\nHe left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.\nThen he came to his disciples, and said to them,\n“Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n\n\nArise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”\n\nWhile he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.\nNow he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.”\nImmediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed him.\nJesus said to him,\n“Friend, why are you here?” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.\nBehold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.\nThen Jesus said to him,\n“Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.\n\n\nOr do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?\n\n\nHow then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?”\n\nIn that hour Jesus said to the multitudes,\n“Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me.\n\n\nBut all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”\nThen all the disciples left him, and fled.\nThose who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.\nBut Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.\nNow the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;\nand they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,\nand said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”\nThe high priest stood up, and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?”\nBut Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”\nJesus said to him,\n“You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”\nThen the high priest tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.\nWhat do you think?”\nThey answered, “He is worthy of death!”\nThen they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,\nsaying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?”\nNow Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!”\nBut he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”\nWhen he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”\nAgain he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.”\nAfter a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.”\nThen he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!”\nImmediately the rooster crowed.\nPeter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him,\n“Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” He went out and wept bitterly.\n",
    "text_english": "When Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,\n\n“You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.”\nThen the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.\nThey took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him.\nBut they said, “Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people.”\nNow when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,\na woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.\nBut when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste?\nFor this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.”\nHowever, knowing this, Jesus said to them,\n“Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good work for me.\n\n\nFor you always have the poor with you; but you don’t always have me.\n\n\nFor in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”\nThen one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,\nand said, “What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?” They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.\nFrom that time he sought opportunity to betray him.\nNow on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”\nHe said,\n“Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.”’”\nThe disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.\nNow when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.\nAs they were eating, he said,\n“Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”\nThey were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?”\nHe answered,\n“He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.\n\n\nThe Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”\nJudas, who betrayed him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?”\nHe said to him,\n“You said it.”\nAs they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said,\n“Take, eat; this is my body.”\nHe took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying,\n“All of you drink it,\n\n\nfor this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.\n\n\nBut I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”\n\nWhen they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\nThen Jesus said to them,\n“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’\n\nBut after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”\n\nBut Peter answered him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”\nPeter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise.\nThen Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples,\n“Sit here, while I go there and pray.”\nHe took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.\nThen he said to them,\n“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me.”\nHe went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying,\n“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”\nHe came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter,\n“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour?\n\n\nWatch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\nAgain, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying,\n“My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.”\n\nHe came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.\nHe left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.\nThen he came to his disciples, and said to them,\n“Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n\n\nArise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”\n\nWhile he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.\nNow he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.”\nImmediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed him.\nJesus said to him,\n“Friend, why are you here?” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.\nBehold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.\nThen Jesus said to him,\n“Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.\n\n\nOr do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?\n\n\nHow then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?”\n\nIn that hour Jesus said to the multitudes,\n“Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me.\n\n\nBut all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”\nThen all the disciples left him, and fled.\nThose who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.\nBut Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.\nNow the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;\nand they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,\nand said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”\nThe high priest stood up, and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?”\nBut Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”\nJesus said to him,\n“You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”\nThen the high priest tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.\nWhat do you think?”\nThey answered, “He is worthy of death!”\nThen they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,\nsaying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ!

You see to it.”\nHe threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.\nThe chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.”\nThey took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in.\nTherefore that field was called “The Field of Blood” to this day.\nThen that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,\n“They took the thirty pieces of silver,\nthe price of him upon whom a price had been set,\nwhom some of the children of Israel priced,\nand they gave them for the potter’s field,\nas the Lord commanded me.”\nNow Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?”\nJesus said to him,\n“So you say.”\nWhen he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.\nThen Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”\nHe gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.\nNow at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.\nThey had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.\nWhen therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?”\nFor he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.\nWhile he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.”\nNow the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.\nBut the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”\nThey said, “Barabbas!”\nPilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?”\nThey all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”\nBut the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?”\nBut they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”\nSo when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”\nAll the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!”\nThen he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.\nThen the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.\nThey stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.\nThey braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”\nThey spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.\nWhen they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.\nAs they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.\nWhen they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,”\nthey gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.\nWhen they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,\nand they sat and watched him there.\nThey set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”\nThen there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.\nThose who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,\nand saying, “You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”\nLikewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said,\n“He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.\nHe trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”\nThe robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.\nNow from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.\nAbout the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,\n“Eli, Eli, lima\nsabachthani?”\n That is,\n“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”\nSome of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”\nImmediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.\nThe rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”\nJesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.\nBehold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.\nThe tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;\nand coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.\nNow the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God.”\nMany women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.\nAmong them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.\nWhen evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus’ disciple came.\nThis man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.\nJoseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,\nand laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone against the door of the tomb, and departed.\nMary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.\nNow on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,\nsaying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’\nCommand therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”\nPilate said to them, “You have a guard.

They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.\nJohn was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.\nHe preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.\nI baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”\nIn those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.\nImmediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.\nA voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”\nImmediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.\nHe was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan.

They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.\nJohn was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.\nHe preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.\nI baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”\nIn those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.\nImmediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.\nA voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”\nImmediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.\nHe was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan.

Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.”\nHe said,\n“Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”\nWhen he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.\nHe said to them,\n“To you is given the mystery of God’s Kingdom, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,\n\n\nthat ‘seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.’”\nHe said to them,\n“Don’t you understand this parable?

Isn’t it put on a stand?\n\n\nFor there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.\n\n\nIf any man has ears to hear, let him hear.”\nHe said to them,\n“Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.\n\n\nFor whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.”\nHe said,\n“God’s Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,\n\n\nand should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, though he doesn’t know how.\n\n\nFor the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.\n\n\nBut when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”\nHe said,\n“How will we liken God’s Kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?\n\n\nIt’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,\n\n\nyet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.”\nWith many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.\nWithout a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.\nOn that day, when evening had come, he said to them,\n“Let’s go over to the other side.”\nLeaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.\nA big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.\nHe himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”\nHe awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,\n“Peace! Be still!” The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.\nHe said to them,\n“Why are you so afraid?

With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.\n\n\nFor whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.”\nHe said,\n“God’s Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,\n\n\nand should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, though he doesn’t know how.\n\n\nFor the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.\n\n\nBut when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”\nHe said,\n“How will we liken God’s Kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?\n\n\nIt’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,\n\n\nyet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.”\nWith many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.\nWithout a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.\nOn that day, when evening had come, he said to them,\n“Let’s go over to the other side.”\nLeaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.\nA big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.\nHe himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”\nHe awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,\n“Peace! Be still!” The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.\nHe said to them,\n“Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”\nThey were greatly afraid, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”\n",

    "text_original": "Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.\nNow when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault.\n(For the Pharisees and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.\nThey don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)\nThe Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”\nHe answered them,\n“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,\n‘This people honors me with their lips,\nbut their heart is far from me.\n\nBut they worship me in vain,\nteaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’\n\n“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”\nHe said to them,\n“Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.\n\n\nFor Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’\nand, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’\n\nBut you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban,\n that is to say, given to God”;’\n\n\nthen you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,\n\n\nmaking void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”\nHe called all the multitude to himself, and said to them,\n“Hear me, all of you, and understand.\n\n\nThere is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.\n\n\nIf anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”\nWhen he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.\nHe said to them,\n“Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,\n\n\nbecause it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?”\n\nHe said,\n“That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.\n\n\nFor from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,\n\n\ncovetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.\n\n\nAll these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”\n\nFrom there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.\nFor a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.\nNow the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.\nBut Jesus said to her,\n“Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”\n\nBut she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”\nHe said to her,\n“For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”\nShe went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.\nAgain he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the region of Decapolis.\nThey brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech.

    "text_english": "Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.\nNow when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault.\n(For the Pharisees and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.\nThey don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)\nThe Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”\nHe answered them,\n“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,\n‘This people honors me with their lips,\nbut their heart is far from me.\n\nBut they worship me in vain,\nteaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’\n\n“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”\nHe said to them,\n“Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.\n\n\nFor Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’\nand, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’\n\nBut you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban,\n that is to say, given to God”;’\n\n\nthen you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,\n\n\nmaking void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”\nHe called all the multitude to himself, and said to them,\n“Hear me, all of you, and understand.\n\n\nThere is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.\n\n\nIf anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”\nWhen he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.\nHe said to them,\n“Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,\n\n\nbecause it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?”\n\nHe said,\n“That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.\n\n\nFor from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,\n\n\ncovetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.\n\n\nAll these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”\n\nFrom there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.\nFor a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.\nNow the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.\nBut Jesus said to her,\n“Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”\n\nBut she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”\nHe said to her,\n“For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”\nShe went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.\nAgain he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the region of Decapolis.\nThey brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.\nHe took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.\nLooking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him,\n“Ephphatha!”\n that is,\n“Be opened!”\nImmediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.\nHe commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.\nThey were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well.

How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?\n\n\nBut I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him.”\nComing to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them.\nImmediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, greeted him.\nHe asked the scribes,\n“What are you asking them?”\nOne of the multitude answered, “Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;\nand wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren’t able.”\nHe answered him,\n“Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you?

As he usually did, he was again teaching them.\nPharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”\nHe answered,\n“What did Moses command you?”\nThey said, “Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.”\nBut Jesus said to them,\n“For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.\n\n\nBut from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.\n\nFor this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,\n\n\nand the two will become one flesh,\nso that they are no longer two, but one flesh.\n\n\nWhat therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.”\n\nIn the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter.\nHe said to them,\n“Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.\n\n\nIf a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery.”\nThey were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.\nBut when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them,\n“Allow the little children to come to me! Don’t forbid them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”\nHe took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them.\nAs he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”\nJesus said to him,\n“Why do you call me good? No one is good except one—God.\n\n\nYou know the commandments: ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’ ‘Do not defraud,’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’”\nHe said to him, “Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.”\nJesus looking at him loved him, and said to him,\n“One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.”\nBut his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.\nJesus looked around, and said to his disciples,\n“How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!”\nThe disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again,\n“Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!\n\n\nIt is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”\nThey were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, “Then who can be saved?”\nJesus, looking at them, said,\n“With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.”\nPeter began to tell him, “Behold, we have left all, and have followed you.”\nJesus said,\n“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,\n\n\nbut he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.\n\n\nBut many who are first will be last; and the last first.”\nThey were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.\n\n“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.\n\n\nThey will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”\nJames and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask.”\nHe said to them,\n“What do you want me to do for you?”\nThey said to him, “Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory.”\nBut Jesus said to them,\n“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”\nThey said to him, “We are able.”\nJesus said to them,\n“You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;\n\n\nbut to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.”\nWhen the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards James and John.\nJesus summoned them, and said to them,\n“You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.\n\n\nBut it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.\n\n\nWhoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”\nThey came to Jericho. As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.\nWhen he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!”\nMany rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!”\nJesus stood still, and said,\n“Call him.”\nThey called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!”\nHe, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.\nJesus asked him,\n“What do you want me to do for you?”\nThe blind man said to him, “Rabboni, that I may see again.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Go your way. Your faith has made you well.”\n Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus on the way.\n",
    "text_english": "He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.\nPharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”\nHe answered,\n“What did Moses command you?”\nThey said, “Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.”\nBut Jesus said to them,\n“For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.\n\n\nBut from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.\n\nFor this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,\n\n\nand the two will become one flesh,\nso that they are no longer two, but one flesh.\n\n\nWhat therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.”\n\nIn the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter.\nHe said to them,\n“Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.\n\n\nIf a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery.”\nThey were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.\nBut when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them,\n“Allow the little children to come to me! Don’t forbid them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”\nHe took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them.\nAs he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”\nJesus said to him,\n“Why do you call me good? No one is good except one—God.\n\n\nYou know the commandments: ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’ ‘Do not defraud,’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’”\nHe said to him, “Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.”\nJesus looking at him loved him, and said to him,\n“One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.”\nBut his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.\nJesus looked around, and said to his disciples,\n“How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!”\nThe disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again,\n“Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!\n\n\nIt is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”\nThey were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, “Then who can be saved?”\nJesus, looking at them, said,\n“With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.”\nPeter began to tell him, “Behold, we have left all, and have followed you.”\nJesus said,\n“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,\n\n\nbut he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.\n\n\nBut many who are first will be last; and the last first.”\nThey were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.\n\n“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.\n\n\nThey will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”\nJames and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask.”\nHe said to them,\n“What do you want me to do for you?”\nThey said to him, “Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory.”\nBut Jesus said to them,\n“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”\nThey said to him, “We are able.”\nJesus said to them,\n“You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;\n\n\nbut to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.”\nWhen the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards James and John.\nJesus summoned them, and said to them,\n“You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.\n\n\nBut it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.\n\n\nWhoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”\nThey came to Jericho.

She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.\nBut there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this ointment been wasted?\nFor this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii,\n and given to the poor.” They grumbled against her.\nBut Jesus said,\n“Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.\n\n\nFor you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me.\n\n\nShe has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.”\nJudas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.\nThey, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him.\nOn the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover?”\nHe sent two of his disciples, and said to them,\n“Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,\n\n\nand wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’\n\n\nHe will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there.”\nHis disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.\nWhen it was evening he came with the twelve.\nAs they sat and were eating, Jesus said,\n“Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me—he who eats with me.”\nThey began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, “Surely not I?” And another said, “Surely not I?”\nHe answered them,\n“It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”\nAs they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said,\n“Take, eat. This is my body.”\nHe took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.\nHe said to them,\n“This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in God’s Kingdom.”\nWhen they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\nJesus said to them,\n“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’\n\nHowever, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”\n\nBut Peter said to him, “Although all will be offended, yet I will not.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”\n\nBut he spoke all the more, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all said the same thing.\nThey came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples,\n“Sit here, while I pray.”\nHe took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.\nHe said to them,\n“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch.”\nHe went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.\nHe said,\n“Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.”\n\nHe came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter,\n“Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you watch one hour?\n\n\nWatch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\nAgain he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.\nAgain he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn’t know what to answer him.\nHe came the third time, and said to them,\n“Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n\n\nArise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”\n\nImmediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.\nNow he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.”\nWhen he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed him.\nThey laid their hands on him, and seized him.\nBut a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.\nJesus answered them,\n“Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?\n\n\nI was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.”\nThey all left him, and fled.\nA certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,\nbut he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.\nThey led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him.\nPeter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.\nNow the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.\nFor many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn’t agree with each other.\nSome stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,\n“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’”\nEven so, their testimony did not agree.\nThe high priest stood up in the middle, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?”\nBut he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”\nJesus said,\n“I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.”\nThe high priest tore his clothes, and said, “What further need have we of witnesses?\nYou have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?” They all condemned him to be worthy of death.\nSome began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, “Prophesy!” The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.\nAs Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,\nand seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!”\nBut he denied it, saying, “I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.” He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.\nThe maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.”\nBut he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.”\nBut he began to curse, and to swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!”\nThe rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him,\n“Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” When he thought about that, he wept.\n",

See how many things they testify against you!”\nBut Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.\nNow at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.\nThere was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.\nThe multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.\nPilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”\nFor he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.\nBut the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.\nPilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”\nThey cried out again, “Crucify him!”\nPilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?”\nBut they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”\nPilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.\nThe soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.\nThey clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.\nThey began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”\nThey struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.\nWhen they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.\nThey compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.\nThey brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”\nThey offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.\nCrucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.\nIt was the third hour,\n and they crucified him.\nThe superscription of his accusation was written over him, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”\nWith him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.\nThe Scripture was fulfilled, which says, “He was counted with transgressors.”\n\nThose who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,\nsave yourself, and come down from the cross!”\nLikewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself.\nLet the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.”\n Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.\nWhen the sixth hour\n had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.\n\nAt the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,\n“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which is, being interpreted,\n“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”\n\nSome of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”\nOne ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”\nJesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.\nThe veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.\nWhen the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”\nThere were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;\nwho, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.\nWhen evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,\nJoseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.\nPilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.\nWhen he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.\nHe bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.\nMary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.\n",

Joseph and his mother didn’t know it,\nbut supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.\nWhen they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.\nAfter three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.\nAll who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.\nWhen they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.”\nHe said to them,\n“Why were you looking for me?

She wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.\nThere were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.\nBehold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.\nThe angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.\nFor there is born to you today, in David’s city, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.\nThis is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.”\nSuddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,\n“Glory to God in the highest,\non earth peace, good will toward men.”\nWhen the angels went away from them into the sky, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”\nThey came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.\nWhen they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.\nAll who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.\nBut Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.\nThe shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.\nWhen eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.\nWhen the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord\n(as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”),\nand to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, “A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”\nBehold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.\nIt had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.\nHe came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law,\nthen he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,\n“Now you are releasing your servant, Master,\naccording to your word, in peace;\nfor my eyes have seen your salvation,\nwhich you have prepared before the face of all peoples;\na light for revelation to the nations,\nand the glory of your people Israel.”\nJoseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,\nand Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, “Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.\nYes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”\nThere was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,\nand she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple, worshiping with fastings and petitions night and day.\nComing up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.\nWhen they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.\nThe child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.\nHis parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.\nWhen he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,\nand when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it,\nbut supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.\nWhen they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.\nAfter three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.\nAll who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.\nWhen they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.”\nHe said to them,\n“Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”\nThey didn’t understand the saying which he spoke to them.\nAnd he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.\nAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.\n",

He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.\nWhen he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,\n“Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.”\nSimon answered him, “Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”\nWhen they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.\nThey beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them.

When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.\nTherefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.\nFor I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”\nWhen Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him,\n“I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”\nThose who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.\nSoon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.\nNow when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.\nWhen the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her,\n“Don’t cry.”\nHe came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said,\n“Young man, I tell you, arise!”\nHe who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.\nFear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited his people!”\nThis report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.\nThe disciples of John told him about all these things.\nJohn, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?”\nWhen the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?’”\nIn that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.\nJesus answered them,\n“Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.\n\n\nBlessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.”\nWhen John’s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John,\n“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?\n\n\nBut what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.\n\n\nBut what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.\n\n\nThis is he of whom it is written,\n‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\nwho will prepare your way before you.’\n\n“For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in God’s Kingdom is greater than he.”\nWhen all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John’s baptism.\nBut the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.\n\n\n“To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?\n\n\nThey are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call to one another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’\n\n\nFor John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’\n\n\nThe Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’\n\n\nWisdom is justified by all her children.”\nOne of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat at the table.\nBehold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment.\nStanding behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.\nNow when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner.”\nJesus answered him,\n“Simon, I have something to tell you.”\n\nHe said, “Teacher, say on.”\n\n“A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.\n\n\nWhen they couldn’t pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?”\nSimon answered, “He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.”\nHe said to him,\n“You have judged correctly.”\nTurning to the woman, he said to Simon,\n“Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.\n\n\nYou gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.\n\n\nYou didn’t anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.\n\n\nTherefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.”\n\nHe said to her,\n“Your sins are forgiven.”\nThose who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”\nHe said to the woman,\n“Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”\n\n",
    "text_english": "After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.\nA certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.\nWhen he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.\nWhen they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him,\nfor he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”\nJesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.\nTherefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.\nFor I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”\nWhen Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him,\n“I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”\nThose who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.\nSoon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain.

With him were the twelve,\nand certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;\nand Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions.\nWhen a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.\n\n“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.\n\n\nOther seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.\n\n\nOther fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.\n\n\nOther fell into the good ground, and grew, and produced one hundred times as much fruit.” As he said these things, he called out,\n“He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”\nThen his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”\nHe said,\n“To you it is given to know the mysteries of God’s Kingdom, but to the rest in parables; that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’\n\nNow the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.\n\n\nThose along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.\n\n\nThose on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.\n\n\nThat which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.\n\n\nThose in the good ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance.\n\n“No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.\n\n\nFor nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.\n\n\nBe careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.”\nHis mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.\nSome people told him, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.”\nBut he answered them,\n“My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.”\nNow on one of those days, he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them,\n“Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out.\nBut as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.\nThey came to him, and awoke him, saying, “Master, master, we are dying!” He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.\nHe said to them,\n“Where is your faith?” Being afraid they marveled, saying to one another, “Who is this then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”\nThey arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.\nWhen Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.\nWhen he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”\nFor Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.\nJesus asked him,\n“What is your name?”\nHe said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.\nThey begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.\nNow there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.\nThe demons came out of the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.\nWhen those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.\nPeople went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.\nThose who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.\nAll the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.\nBut the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,\n\n“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.” He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.\nWhen Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.\nBehold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house,\nfor he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.\nA woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,\ncame behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.\nJesus said,\n“Who touched me?”\nWhen all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say,\n‘Who touched me?’”\nBut Jesus said,\n“Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”\nWhen the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.\nHe said to her,\n“Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”\nWhile he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”\nBut Jesus hearing it, answered him,\n“Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”\nWhen he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.\nAll were weeping and mourning her, but he said,\n“Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”\nThey were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.\nBut he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying,\n“Child, arise!”\nHer spirit returned, and she rose up immediately.

    "text_original": "He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.\nHe sent them out to preach God’s Kingdom and to heal the sick.\nHe said to them,\n“Take nothing for your journey—neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats each.\n\n\nInto whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.\n\n\nAs many as don’t receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.”\nThey departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.\nNow Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,\nand by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.\nHerod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?” He sought to see him.\nThe apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done.\nHe took them, and withdrew apart to a desert region of a city called Bethsaida.\nBut the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of God’s Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing.\nThe day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.”\nBut he said to them,\n“You give them something to eat.”\nThey said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.”\nFor they were about five thousand men.\nHe said to his disciples,\n“Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”\nThey did so, and made them all sit down.\nHe took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.\nThey ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.\nAs he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he asked them,\n“Who do the multitudes say that I am?”\nThey answered, “‘John the Baptizer,’ but others say, ‘Elijah,’ and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.”\nHe said to them,\n“But who do you say that I am?”\nPeter answered, “The Christ of God.”\nBut he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,\nsaying,\n“The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.”\nHe said to all,\n“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross,\nand follow me.\n\n\nFor whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.\n\n\nFor what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?\n\n\nFor whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.\n\n\nBut I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see God’s Kingdom.”\n\nAbout eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.\nAs he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.\nBehold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,\nwho appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.\nNow Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.\nAs they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.\nWhile he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.\nA voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”\nWhen the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.\nOn the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.\nBehold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.\nBehold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.\nI begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”\nJesus answered,\n“Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”\nWhile he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.\nThey were all astonished at the majesty of God.\nBut while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,\n\n“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”\nBut they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.\nThere arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.\nJesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,\nand said to them,\n“Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.”\nJohn answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”\nIt came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,\nand sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.\nThey didn’t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.\nWhen his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?”\nBut he turned and rebuked them,\n“You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”\nThey went to another village.\nAs they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”\nJesus said to him,\n“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”\nHe said to another,\n“Follow me!”\nBut he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”\nBut Jesus said to him,\n“Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce God’s Kingdom.”\nAnother also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.”\nBut Jesus said to him,\n“No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for God’s Kingdom.”\n",
    "text_english": "He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.\nHe sent them out to preach God’s Kingdom and to heal the sick.\nHe said to them,\n“Take nothing for your journey—neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats each.\n\n\nInto whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.\n\n\nAs many as don’t receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.”\nThey departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.\nNow Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,\nand by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.\nHerod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?” He sought to see him.\nThe apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done.\nHe took them, and withdrew apart to a desert region of a city called Bethsaida.\nBut the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of God’s Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing.\nThe day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.”\nBut he said to them,\n“You give them something to eat.”\nThey said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.”\nFor they were about five thousand men.\nHe said to his disciples,\n“Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”\nThey did so, and made them all sit down.\nHe took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.\nThey ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.\nAs he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he asked them,\n“Who do the multitudes say that I am?”\nThey answered, “‘John the Baptizer,’ but others say, ‘Elijah,’ and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.”\nHe said to them,\n“But who do you say that I am?”\nPeter answered, “The Christ of God.”\nBut he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,\nsaying,\n“The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.”\nHe said to all,\n“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross,\nand follow me.\n\n\nFor whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.\n\n\nFor what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?\n\n\nFor whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.\n\n\nBut I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see God’s Kingdom.”\n\nAbout eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.\nAs he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.\nBehold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,\nwho appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.\nNow Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.\nAs they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.\nWhile he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.\nA voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”\nWhen the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.\nOn the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.\nBehold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.\nBehold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.\nI begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”\nJesus answered,\n“Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”\nWhile he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.\nThey were all astonished at the majesty of God.\nBut while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,\n\n“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”\nBut they didn’t understand this saying.

Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.”\nJohn answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”\nIt came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,\nand sent messengers before his face.

The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’?\n\n\nI tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.\n\n“I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.\n\n\nFor everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.\n\n“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?\n\n\nOr if he asks for an egg, he won’t give him a scorpion, will he?\n\n\nIf you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”\nHe was casting out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.\nBut some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”\nOthers, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.\nBut he, knowing their thoughts, said to them,\n“Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.\n\n\nIf Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.\n\n\nBut if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.\n\n\nBut if I by God’s finger cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come to you.\n\n“When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.\n\n\nBut when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his plunder.\n\n\n“He that is not with me is against me. He who doesn’t gather with me scatters.\n\n\nThe unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, ‘I will turn back to my house from which I came out.’\n\n\nWhen he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.\n\n\nThen he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”\nIt came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!”\nBut he said,\n“On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.”\nWhen the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say,\n“This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet.\n\n\nFor even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.\n\n\nThe Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.\n\n\nThe men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.\n\n“No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.\n\n\nThe lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.\n\n\nTherefore see whether the light that is in you isn’t darkness.\n\n\nIf therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”\nNow as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table.\nWhen the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.\nThe Lord said to him,\n“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.\n\n\nYou foolish ones, didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also?\n\n\nBut give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.\n\n\nBut woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and God’s love. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.\n\n\nWoe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.\n\n\nWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don’t know it.”\nOne of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.”\nHe said,\n“Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.\n\n\nWoe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.\n\n\nSo you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.\n\n\nTherefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,\n\n\nthat the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;\n\n\nfrom the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.\n\n\nWoe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.”\n\nAs he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;\nlying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.\n",

Therefore will they be your judges.\n\n\nBut if I by God’s finger cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come to you.\n\n“When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.\n\n\nBut when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his plunder.\n\n\n“He that is not with me is against me. He who doesn’t gather with me scatters.\n\n\nThe unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, ‘I will turn back to my house from which I came out.’\n\n\nWhen he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.\n\n\nThen he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”\nIt came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!”\nBut he said,\n“On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.”\nWhen the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say,\n“This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet.\n\n\nFor even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.\n\n\nThe Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.\n\n\nThe men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.\n\n“No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.\n\n\nThe lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.\n\n\nTherefore see whether the light that is in you isn’t darkness.\n\n\nIf therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”\nNow as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table.\nWhen the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.\nThe Lord said to him,\n“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.\n\n\nYou foolish ones, didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also?\n\n\nBut give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.\n\n\nBut woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and God’s love. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.\n\n\nWoe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.\n\n\nWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don’t know it.”\nOne of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.”\nHe said,\n“Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.\n\n\nWoe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.\n\n\nSo you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.\n\n\nTherefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,\n\n\nthat the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;\n\n\nfrom the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.\n\n\nWoe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.”\n\nAs he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;\nlying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.\n",

For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous.”\n\nWhen one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, “Blessed is he who will feast in God’s Kingdom!”\nBut he said to him,\n“A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people.\n\n\nHe sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, ‘Come, for everything is ready now.’\n\n\nThey all as one began to make excuses.\n“The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.’\n\n“Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.’\n\n“Another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I can’t come.’\n\n\n“That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.’\n\n“The servant said, ‘Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.’\n\n“The lord said to the servant, ‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.\n\n\nFor I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.’”\nNow great multitudes were going with him. He turned and said to them,\n\n“If anyone comes to me, and doesn’t disregard\nhis own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can’t be my disciple.\n\n\nWhoever doesn’t bear his own cross, and come after me, can’t be my disciple.\n\n\nFor which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesn’t first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?\n\n\nOr perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,\n\n\nsaying, ‘This man began to build, and wasn’t able to finish.’\n\n\nOr what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?\n\n\nOr else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.\n\n\nSo therefore whoever of you who doesn’t renounce all that he has, he can’t be my disciple.\n\n\nSalt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?\n\n\nIt is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile.

If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.\n\n\nIf he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.”\nThe apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”\nThe Lord said,\n“If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.\n\n\nBut who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at the table,’\n\n\nand will not rather tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’?\n\n\nDoes he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.\n\n\nEven so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’”\n\nAs he was on his way to Jerusalem, he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.\nAs he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance.\nThey lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”\nWhen he saw them, he said to them,\n“Go and show yourselves to the priests.” As they went, they were cleansed.\nOne of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.\nHe fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.\nJesus answered,\n“Weren’t the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?\n\n\nWere there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?”\nThen he said to him,\n“Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.”\nBeing asked by the Pharisees when God’s Kingdom would come, he answered them,\n“God’s Kingdom doesn’t come with observation;\n\n\nneither will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, God’s Kingdom is within you.”\nHe said to the disciples,\n“The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.\n\n\nThey will tell you, ‘Look, here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ Don’t go away, nor follow after them,\n\n\nfor as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day.\n\n\nBut first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.\n\n\nAs it was in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.\n\n\nThey ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.\n\n\nLikewise, even as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;\n\n\nbut in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all.\n\n\nIt will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.\n\n\nIn that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.\n\n\nRemember Lot’s wife!\n\n\nWhoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.\n\n\nI tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.\n\n\nThere will be two grinding grain together.

    "text_english": "He said to the disciples,\n“It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!\n\n\nIt would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.\n\n\nBe careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.\n\n\nIf he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.”\nThe apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”\nThe Lord said,\n“If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.\n\n\nBut who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at the table,’\n\n\nand will not rather tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’?\n\n\nDoes he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.\n\n\nEven so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’”\n\nAs he was on his way to Jerusalem, he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.\nAs he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance.\nThey lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”\nWhen he saw them, he said to them,\n“Go and show yourselves to the priests.” As they went, they were cleansed.\nOne of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.\nHe fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.\nJesus answered,\n“Weren’t the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?\n\n\nWere there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?”\nThen he said to him,\n“Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.”\nBeing asked by the Pharisees when God’s Kingdom would come, he answered them,\n“God’s Kingdom doesn’t come with observation;\n\n\nneither will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, God’s Kingdom is within you.”\nHe said to the disciples,\n“The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.\n\n\nThey will tell you, ‘Look, here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ Don’t go away, nor follow after them,\n\n\nfor as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day.\n\n\nBut first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.\n\n\nAs it was in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.\n\n\nThey ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.\n\n\nLikewise, even as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;\n\n\nbut in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all.\n\n\nIt will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.\n\n\nIn that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.\n\n\nRemember Lot’s wife!\n\n\nWhoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.\n\n\nI tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.\n\n\nThere will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left.”\n\n\nThey, answering, asked him, “Where, Lord?”\nHe said to them,\n“Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together.”\n",

Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”\nHe spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.\n\n“Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.\n\n\nThe Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.\n\n\nI fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’\n\n\nBut the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’\n\n\nI tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”\nThey were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.\nJesus summoned them, saying,\n“Allow the little children to come to me, and don’t hinder them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these.\n\n\nMost certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn’t receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”\nA certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”\nJesus asked him,\n“Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one—God.\n\n\nYou know the commandments: ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false testimony,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’”\nHe said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.”\nWhen Jesus heard these things, he said to him,\n“You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me.”\nBut when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.\nJesus, seeing that he became very sad, said,\n“How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!\n\n\nFor it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”\nThose who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”\nBut he said,\n“The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.”\nPeter said, “Look, we have left everything, and followed you.”\nHe said to them,\n“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for God’s Kingdom’s sake,\n\n\nwho will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.”\nHe took the twelve aside, and said to them,\n“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed.\n\n\nFor he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.\n\n\nThey will scourge and kill him.

If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.”\n\nAs they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that God’s Kingdom would be revealed immediately.\nHe said therefore,\n“A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.\n\n\nHe called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins,\n\nand told them, ‘Conduct business until I come.’\n\n\nBut his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this man to reign over us.’\n\n“When he had come back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.\n\n\nThe first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.’\n\n“He said to him, ‘Well done, you good servant!

You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and reap that which you didn’t sow.’\n\n“He said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down, and reaping that which I didn’t sow.\n\n\nThen why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?’\n\n\nHe said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.’\n\n“They said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’\n\n\n‘For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.\n\n\nBut bring those enemies of mine who didn’t want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.’”\nHaving said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.\nWhen he came near to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,\nsaying,\n“Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, which no man had ever sat upon.

    "text_original": "Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.\nThe chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.\nSatan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve.\nHe went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.\nThey were glad, and agreed to give him money.\nHe consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.\nThe day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.\nJesus sent Peter and John, saying,\n“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”\nThey said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”\nHe said to them,\n“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.\n\n\nTell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’\n\n\nHe will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”\nThey went, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.\nWhen the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.\nHe said to them,\n“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,\n\n\nfor I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”\nHe received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said,\n“Take this, and share it among yourselves,\n\n\nfor I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”\nHe took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke, and gave it to them, saying,\n“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”\nLikewise, he took the cup after supper, saying,\n“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\n\n\nBut behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.\n\n\nThe Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”\nThey began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.\nThere arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.\nHe said to them,\n“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’\n\n\nBut not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.\n\n\nFor who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.\n\n\nBut you are those who have continued with me in my trials.\n\n\nI confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,\n\n\nthat you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”\nThe Lord said,\n“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat,\n\n\nbut I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.”\nHe said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”\nHe said,\n“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”\nHe said to them,\n“When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?”\nThey said, “Nothing.”\nThen he said to them,\n“But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.\n\n\nFor I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’\nFor that which concerns me has an end.”\nThey said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.”\nHe said to them,\n“That is enough.”\nHe came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.\nWhen he was at the place, he said to them,\n“Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”\nHe was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,\nsaying,\n“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.

Who is the one who struck you?”\nThey spoke many other things against him, insulting him.\nAs soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,\n“If you are the Christ, tell us.”\nBut he said to them,\n“If I tell you, you won’t believe,\n\n\nand if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.\n\n\nFrom now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”\nThey all said, “Are you then the Son of God?”\nHe said to them,\n“You say it, because I am.”\nThey said, “Why do we need any more witness?

    "text_english": "Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.\nThe chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.\nSatan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve.\nHe went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.\nThey were glad, and agreed to give him money.\nHe consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.\nThe day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.\nJesus sent Peter and John, saying,\n“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”\nThey said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”\nHe said to them,\n“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.\n\n\nTell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’\n\n\nHe will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”\nThey went, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.\nWhen the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.\nHe said to them,\n“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,\n\n\nfor I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”\nHe received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said,\n“Take this, and share it among yourselves,\n\n\nfor I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”\nHe took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke, and gave it to them, saying,\n“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”\nLikewise, he took the cup after supper, saying,\n“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\n\n\nBut behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.\n\n\nThe Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”\nThey began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.\nThere arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.\nHe said to them,\n“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’\n\n\nBut not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.\n\n\nFor who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.\n\n\nBut you are those who have continued with me in my trials.\n\n\nI confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,\n\n\nthat you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”\nThe Lord said,\n“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat,\n\n\nbut I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.”\nHe said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”\nHe said,\n“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”\nHe said to them,\n“When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?”\nThey said, “Nothing.”\nThen he said to them,\n“But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.\n\n\nFor I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’\nFor that which concerns me has an end.”\nThey said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.”\nHe said to them,\n“That is enough.”\nHe came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.\nWhen he was at the place, he said to them,\n“Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”\nHe was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,\nsaying,\n“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”\nAn angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.\nBeing in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.\nWhen he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,\nand said to them,\n“Why do you sleep?

Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”\nWhen he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.\nWhile they still didn’t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them,\n“Do you have anything here to eat?”\nThey gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.\nHe took them, and ate in front of them.\nHe said to them,\n“This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.”\nThen he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.\nHe said to them,\n“Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,\n\n\nand that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\n\n\nYou are witnesses of these things.\n\n\nBehold, I send out the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.”\n\nHe led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.\nWhile he blessed them, he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.\nThey worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,\nand were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.\n",

    "text_original": "Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John\n(although Jesus himself didn’t baptize, but his disciples),\nhe left Judea, and departed into Galilee.\nHe needed to pass through Samaria.\nSo he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.\nJacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.\nA woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her,\n“Give me a drink.”\nFor his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.\nThe Samaritan woman therefore said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)\nJesus answered her,\n“If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”\nThe woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get that living water?\nAre you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?”\nJesus answered her,\n“Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,\n\n\nbut whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”\nThe woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.”\nJesus said to her,\n“Go, call your husband, and come here.”\n\nThe woman answered, “I have no husband.”\nJesus said to her,\n“You said well, ‘I have no husband,’\n\n\nfor you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.”\nThe woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.\nOur fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.”\nJesus said to her,\n“Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.\n\n\nYou worship that which you don’t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.\n\n\nBut the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshipers.\n\n\nGod is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”\nThe woman said to him, “I know that Messiah comes, he who is called Christ. When he has come, he will declare to us all things.”\nJesus said to her,\n“I am he, the one who speaks to you.”\nAt this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you speak with her?”\nSo the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,\n“Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?”\nThey went out of the city, and were coming to him.\nIn the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”\nBut he said to them,\n“I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”\nThe disciples therefore said to one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?”\nJesus said to them,\n“My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.\n\n\nDon’t you say, ‘There are yet four months until the harvest?’ Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.\n\n\nHe who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.\n\n\nFor in this the saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’\n\n\nI sent you to reap that for which you haven’t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”\nFrom that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, “He told me everything that I did.”\nSo when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.\nMany more believed because of his word.\nThey said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.”\nAfter the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.\nFor Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.\nSo when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.\nJesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.\nWhen he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.\nJesus therefore said to him,\n“Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.”\nThe nobleman said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Go your way. Your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.\nAs he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying “Your child lives!”\nSo he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him.”\nSo the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him,\n“Your son lives.” He believed, as did his whole house.\nThis is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.\n",
    "text_english": "Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John\n(although Jesus himself didn’t baptize, but his disciples),\nhe left Judea, and departed into Galilee.\nHe needed to pass through Samaria.\nSo he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.\nJacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.\nA woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her,\n“Give me a drink.”\nFor his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.\nThe Samaritan woman therefore said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)\nJesus answered her,\n“If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”\nThe woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get that living water?\nAre you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?”\nJesus answered her,\n“Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,\n\n\nbut whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”\nThe woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.”\nJesus said to her,\n“Go, call your husband, and come here.”\n\nThe woman answered, “I have no husband.”\nJesus said to her,\n“You said well, ‘I have no husband,’\n\n\nfor you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.”\nThe woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.\nOur fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.”\nJesus said to her,\n“Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.\n\n\nYou worship that which you don’t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.\n\n\nBut the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshipers.\n\n\nGod is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”\nThe woman said to him, “I know that Messiah comes, he who is called Christ. When he has come, he will declare to us all things.”\nJesus said to her,\n“I am he, the one who speaks to you.”\nAt this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you speak with her?”\nSo the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,\n“Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?”\nThey went out of the city, and were coming to him.\nIn the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”\nBut he said to them,\n“I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”\nThe disciples therefore said to one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?”\nJesus said to them,\n“My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.\n\n\nDon’t you say, ‘There are yet four months until the harvest?’ Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.\n\n\nHe who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.\n\n\nFor in this the saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’\n\n\nI sent you to reap that for which you haven’t labored.

So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.\nJesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.\nWhen they were filled, he said to his disciples,\n“Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost.”\nSo they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.\nWhen therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, “This is truly the prophet who comes into the world.”\nJesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.\nWhen evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,\nand they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.\nThe sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.\nWhen therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia,\n they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.\nBut he said to them,\n“It is I.\nDon’t be afraid.”\nThey were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.\nOn the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn’t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.\nHowever boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.\nWhen the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn’t there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.\nWhen they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”\nJesus answered them,\n“Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.\n\n\nDon’t work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.”\nThey said therefore to him, “What must we do, that we may work the works of God?”\nJesus answered them,\n“This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”\nThey said therefore to him, “What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?\nOur fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, ‘He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.’”\nJesus therefore said to them,\n“Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn’t Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.\n\n\nFor the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.”\nThey said therefore to him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”\nJesus said to them,\n“I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.\n\n\nBut I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don’t believe.\n\n\nAll those whom the Father gives me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out.\n\n\nFor I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.\n\n\nThis is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.\n\n\nThis is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.”\nThe Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said,\n“I am the bread which came down out of heaven.”\nThey said, “Isn’t this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say,\n‘I have come down out of heaven?’”\n\nTherefore Jesus answered them,\n“Don’t murmur among yourselves.\n\n\nNo one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.\n\n\nIt is written in the prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’\n\n\nTherefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.\n\n\nNot that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.\n\n\nMost certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.\n\n\nI am the bread of life.\n\n\nYour fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.\n\n\nThis is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.\n\n\nI am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”\nThe Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”\nJesus therefore said to them,\n“Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don’t have life in yourselves.\n\n\nHe who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\n\n\nFor my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.\n\n\nHe who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.\n\n\nAs the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.\n\n\nThis is the bread which came down out of heaven—not as our fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.”\nHe said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.\nTherefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?”\nBut Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them,\n“Does this cause you to stumble?\n\n\nThen what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?\n\n\nIt is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.\n\n\nBut there are some of you who don’t believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn’t believe, and who it was who would betray him.\nHe said,\n“For this cause I have said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.”\nAt this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.\nJesus said therefore to the twelve,\n“You don’t also want to go away, do you?”\nSimon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.\nWe have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”\nJesus answered them,\n“Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?”\nNow he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.\n",

Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.\nOn the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn’t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.\nHowever boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.\nWhen the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn’t there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.\nWhen they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”\nJesus answered them,\n“Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.\n\n\nDon’t work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.”\nThey said therefore to him, “What must we do, that we may work the works of God?”\nJesus answered them,\n“This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”\nThey said therefore to him, “What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?\nOur fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, ‘He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.’”\nJesus therefore said to them,\n“Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn’t Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.\n\n\nFor the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.”\nThey said therefore to him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”\nJesus said to them,\n“I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.\n\n\nBut I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don’t believe.\n\n\nAll those whom the Father gives me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out.\n\n\nFor I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.\n\n\nThis is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.\n\n\nThis is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.”\nThe Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said,\n“I am the bread which came down out of heaven.”\nThey said, “Isn’t this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say,\n‘I have come down out of heaven?’”\n\nTherefore Jesus answered them,\n“Don’t murmur among yourselves.\n\n\nNo one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.\n\n\nIt is written in the prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’\n\n\nTherefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.\n\n\nNot that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.\n\n\nMost certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.\n\n\nI am the bread of life.\n\n\nYour fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.\n\n\nThis is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.\n\n\nI am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”\nThe Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”\nJesus therefore said to them,\n“Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don’t have life in yourselves.\n\n\nHe who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\n\n\nFor my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.\n\n\nHe who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.\n\n\nAs the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.\n\n\nThis is the bread which came down out of heaven—not as our fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.”\nHe said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.\nTherefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?”\nBut Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them,\n“Does this cause you to stumble?\n\n\nThen what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?\n\n\nIt is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.\n\n\nBut there are some of you who don’t believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn’t believe, and who it was who would betray him.\nHe said,\n“For this cause I have said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.”\nAt this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.\nJesus said therefore to the twelve,\n“You don’t also want to go away, do you?”\nSimon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.\nWe have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”\nJesus answered them,\n“Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?”\nNow he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.\n",

However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world.”\nThey didn’t understand that he spoke to them about the Father.\nJesus therefore said to them,\n“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things.\n\n\nHe who sent me is with me.

How do you say,\n‘You will be made free’?”\nJesus answered them,\n“Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin.\n\n\nA bondservant doesn’t live in the house forever. A son remains forever.\n\n\nIf therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.\n\n\nI know that you are Abraham’s offspring, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.\n\n\nI say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father.”\nThey answered him, “Our father is Abraham.”\nJesus said to them,\n“If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.\n\n\nBut now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn’t do this.\n\n\nYou do the works of your father.”\nThey said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality.

For I haven’t come of myself, but he sent me.\n\n\nWhy don’t you understand my speech? Because you can’t hear my word.\n\n\nYou are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn’t stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.

For this cause you don’t hear, because you are not of God.”\nThen the Jews answered him, “Don’t we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?”\nJesus answered,\n“I don’t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.\n\n\nBut I don’t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.\n\n\nMost certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.”\nThen the Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say,\n‘If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.’\nAre you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?”\nJesus answered,\n“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.\n\n\nYou have not known him, but I know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.\n\n\nYour father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad.”\nThe Jews therefore said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”\nJesus said to them,\n“Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM.”\nTherefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the middle of them, and so passed by.\n",

When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and the father of lies.\n\n\nBut because I tell the truth, you don’t believe me.\n\n\nWhich of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?\n\n\nHe who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don’t hear, because you are not of God.”\nThen the Jews answered him, “Don’t we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?”\nJesus answered,\n“I don’t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.\n\n\nBut I don’t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.\n\n\nMost certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.”\nThen the Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say,\n‘If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.’\nAre you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?”\nJesus answered,\n“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.\n\n\nYou have not known him, but I know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.\n\n\nYour father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad.”\nThe Jews therefore said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”\nJesus said to them,\n“Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM.”\nTherefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the middle of them, and so passed by.\n",

The night is coming, when no one can work.\n\n\nWhile I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”\nWhen he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud,\nand said to him,\n“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.\nThe neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?”\nOthers were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.”\nHe said, “I am he.”\nThey therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”\nHe answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me,\n‘Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.’ So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”\nThen they asked him, “Where is he?”\nHe said, “I don’t know.”\nThey brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.\nIt was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.\nAgain therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”\nSome therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” There was division among them.\nTherefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?”\nHe said, “He is a prophet.”\nThe Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,\nand asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind?

He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.”\nHis parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.\nTherefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”\nSo they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”\nHe therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”\nThey said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”\nHe answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen.

If a man walks in the day, he doesn’t stumble, because he sees the light of this world.\n\n\nBut if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isn’t in him.”\nHe said these things, and after that, he said to them,\n“Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep.”\nThe disciples therefore said, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”\nNow Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.\nSo Jesus said to them plainly then,\n“Lazarus is dead.\n\n\nI am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let’s go to him.”\nThomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, “Let’s go also, that we may die with him.”\nSo when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.\nNow Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.\nMany of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.\nThen when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.\nTherefore Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.\nEven now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.”\nJesus said to her,\n“Your brother will rise again.”\nMartha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”\nJesus said to her,\n“I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies.\n\n\nWhoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”\nShe said to him, “Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God’s Son, he who comes into the world.”\nWhen she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, “The Teacher is here, and is calling you.”\nWhen she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.\nNow Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.\nThen the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to weep there.”\nTherefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”\nWhen Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,\nand said,\n“Where have you laid him?”\nThey told him, “Lord, come and see.”\nJesus wept.\nThe Jews therefore said, “See how much affection he had for him!”\nSome of them said, “Couldn’t this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?”\nJesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.\nJesus said,\n“Take away the stone.”\nMartha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.”\nJesus said to her,\n“Didn’t I tell you that if you believed, you would see God’s glory?”\nSo they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said,\n“Father, I thank you that you listened to me.\n\n\nI know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude standing around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me.”\n\nWhen he had said this, he cried with a loud voice,\n“Lazarus, come out!”\nHe who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.\nJesus said to them,\n“Free him, and let him go.”\nTherefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him.\nBut some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.\nThe chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, “What are we doing? For this man does many signs.\nIf we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”\nBut a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all,\nnor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.”\nNow he didn’t say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,\nand not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.\nSo from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death.\nJesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.\nNow the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.\nThen they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, “What do you think—that he isn’t coming to the feast at all?”\nNow the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.\n",

I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God’s Son, he who comes into the world.”\nWhen she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, “The Teacher is here, and is calling you.”\nWhen she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.\nNow Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.\nThen the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to weep there.”\nTherefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”\nWhen Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,\nand said,\n“Where have you laid him?”\nThey told him, “Lord, come and see.”\nJesus wept.\nThe Jews therefore said, “See how much affection he had for him!”\nSome of them said, “Couldn’t this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?”\nJesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.\nJesus said,\n“Take away the stone.”\nMartha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.”\nJesus said to her,\n“Didn’t I tell you that if you believed, you would see God’s glory?”\nSo they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said,\n“Father, I thank you that you listened to me.\n\n\nI know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude standing around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me.”\n\nWhen he had said this, he cried with a loud voice,\n“Lazarus, come out!”\nHe who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.\nJesus said to them,\n“Free him, and let him go.”\nTherefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him.\nBut some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.\nThe chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, “What are we doing? For this man does many signs.\nIf we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”\nBut a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all,\nnor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.”\nNow he didn’t say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,\nand not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.\nSo from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death.\nJesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.\nNow the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.\nThen they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, “What do you think—that he isn’t coming to the feast at all?”\nNow the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.\n",

We don’t know what he is saying.”\nTherefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them,\n“Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?’\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.\n\n\nA woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn’t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.\n\n\nTherefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.\n\n“In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.\n\n\nUntil now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.\n\n\nI have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.\n\n\nIn that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,\n\n\nfor the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God.\n\n\nI came from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.”\nHis disciples said to him, “Behold, now you are speaking plainly, and using no figures of speech.\nNow we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.”\nJesus answered them,\n“Do you now believe?\n\n\nBehold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.\n\n\nI have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.”\n\n",

Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;\nbut Peter was standing at the door outside.

They said therefore to him, “You aren’t also one of his disciples, are you?”\nHe denied it, and said, “I am not.”\nOne of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?”\nPeter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.\nThey led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn’t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.\nPilate therefore went out to them, and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”\nThey answered him, “If this man weren’t an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up to you.”\nPilate therefore said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.”\nTherefore the Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,”\nthat the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.\nPilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”\nJesus answered him,\n“Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?”\nPilate answered, “I’m not a Jew, am I?

Pilate said to them, “Behold, the man!”\nWhen therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!”\nPilate said to them, “Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.”\nThe Jews answered him, “We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.”\nWhen therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.\nHe entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.\nPilate therefore said to him, “Aren’t you speaking to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”\nJesus answered,\n“You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.”\nAt this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this man, you aren’t Caesar’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!”\nWhen Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called “The Pavement”, but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.”\nNow it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, “Behold, your King!”\nThey cried out, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!”\nPilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”\nThe chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”\nSo then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.\nHe went out, bearing his cross, to the place called “The Place of a Skull”, which is called in Hebrew, “Golgotha”,\nwhere they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.\nPilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”\nTherefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.\nThe chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘he said, “I am King of the Jews.”’”\nPilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”\nThen the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.\nThen they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,\n“They parted my garments among them.\nFor my cloak they cast lots.”\nTherefore the soldiers did these things.\nBut there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.\nTherefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother,\n“Woman, behold, your son!”\n\nThen he said to the disciple,\n“Behold, your mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.\nAfter this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said,\n“I am thirsty.”\nNow a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.\nWhen Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said,\n“It is finished.” He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.\nTherefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn’t remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.\nTherefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;\nbut when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn’t break his legs.\nHowever one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.\nHe who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.\nFor these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him will not be broken.”\nAgain another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they pierced.”\nAfter these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus’ body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.\nNicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.\nSo they took Jesus’ body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.\nNow in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.\nThen because of the Jews’ Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.\n",

He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.\nFor these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him will not be broken.”\nAgain another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they pierced.”\nAfter these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus’ body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.\nNicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.\nSo they took Jesus’ body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.\nNow in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.\nThen because of the Jews’ Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.\n",

The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.\nStooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn’t enter in.\nThen Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,\nand the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.\nSo then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.\nFor as yet they didn’t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.\nSo the disciples went away again to their own homes.\nBut Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,\nand she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\nThey told her, “Woman, why are you weeping?”\nShe said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have laid him.”\nWhen she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn’t know that it was Jesus.\nJesus said to her,\n“Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?”\nShe, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”\nJesus said to her,\n“Mary.”\nShe turned and said to him, “Rabboni!” which is to say, “Teacher!”\nJesus said to her,\n“Don’t hold me, for I haven’t yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”\nMary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.\nWhen therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the middle, and said to them,\n“Peace be to you.”\nWhen he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.\nJesus therefore said to them again,\n“Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.”\nWhen he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them,\n“Receive the Holy Spirit!\n\n\nIf you forgive anyone’s sins, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyone’s sins, they have been retained.”\nBut Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn’t with them when Jesus came.\nThe other disciples therefore said to him, “We have seen the Lord!”\nBut he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”\nAfter eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the middle, and said,\n“Peace be to you.”\nThen he said to Thomas,\n“Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Don’t be unbelieving, but believing.”\nThomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!”\nJesus said to him,\n“Because you have seen me,\nyou have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed.”\nTherefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;\nbut these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.\n",

But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.\nTherefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might produce fruit to God.\nFor when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring out fruit to death.\nBut now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.\nWhat shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn’t have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn’t have known coveting, unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.”\nBut sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.\nI was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.\nThe commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;\nfor sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.\nTherefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.\nDid then that which is good become death to me? May it never be!

For I don’t practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.\nBut if what I don’t desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.\nSo now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.\nFor I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don’t find it doing that which is good.\nFor the good which I desire, I don’t do; but the evil which I don’t desire, that I practice.\nBut if what I don’t desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.\nI find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present.\nFor I delight in God’s law after the inward man,\nbut I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.\nWhat a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?\nI thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord! So then with the mind, I myself serve God’s law, but with the flesh, the sin’s law.\n",

But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.\nTherefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might produce fruit to God.\nFor when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring out fruit to death.\nBut now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.\nWhat shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn’t have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn’t have known coveting, unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.”\nBut sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.\nI was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.\nThe commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;\nfor sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.\nTherefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.\nDid then that which is good become death to me? May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, was producing death in me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceedingly sinful.\nFor we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.\nFor I don’t know what I am doing. For I don’t practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.\nBut if what I don’t desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.\nSo now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.\nFor I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don’t find it doing that which is good.\nFor the good which I desire, I don’t do; but the evil which I don’t desire, that I practice.\nBut if what I don’t desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.\nI find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present.\nFor I delight in God’s law after the inward man,\nbut I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.\nWhat a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?\nI thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord! So then with the mind, I myself serve God’s law, but with the flesh, the sin’s law.\n",

    "text_original": "There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don’t walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.\nFor the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.\nFor what the law couldn’t do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;\nthat the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\nFor those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.\nFor the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;\nbecause the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God; for it is not subject to God’s law, neither indeed can it be.\nThose who are in the flesh can’t please God.\nBut you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any man doesn’t have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.\nIf Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.\nBut if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.\nSo then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.\nFor if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.\nFor as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God.\nFor you didn’t receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!”\nThe Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God;\nand if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.\nFor I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.\nFor the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.\nFor the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope\nthat the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.\nFor we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.\nNot only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.\nFor we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?\nBut if we hope for that which we don’t see, we wait for it with patience.\nIn the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don’t know how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can’t be uttered.\nHe who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit’s mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God.\nWe know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.\nFor whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.\nWhom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he justified, those he also glorified.\nWhat then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?\nHe who didn’t spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?\nWho could bring a charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God who justifies.\nWho is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.\nWho shall separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\nEven as it is written,\n“For your sake we are killed all day long.\nWe were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.”\nNo, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.\nFor I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,\nnor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from God’s love, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n",

Likewise also the husband doesn’t have authority over his own body, but the wife.\nDon’t deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn’t tempt you because of your lack of self-control.\nBut this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.\nYet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind.\nBut I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am.\nBut if they don’t have self-control, let them marry. For it’s better to marry than to burn.\nBut to the married I command—not I, but the Lord—that the wife not leave her husband\n(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife.\nBut to the rest I—not the Lord—say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.\nThe woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband.\nFor the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.\nYet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.\nFor how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?\nOnly, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the assemblies.\nWas anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.\nCircumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.\nLet each man stay in that calling in which he was called.\nWere you called being a bondservant? Don’t let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it.\nFor he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord’s free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ’s bondservant.\nYou were bought with a price. Don’t become bondservants of men.\nBrothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God.\nNow concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.\nTherefore I think that because of the distress that is on us, that it’s good for a man to remain as he is.\nAre you bound to a wife? Don’t seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don’t seek a wife.\nBut if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.\nBut I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;\nand those who weep, as though they didn’t weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn’t rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn’t possess;\nand those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away.\nBut I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;\nbut he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.\nThere is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world—how she may please her husband.\nThis I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.\nBut if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn’t sin. Let them marry.\nBut he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no urgency, but has power over his own will, and has determined in his own heart to keep his own virgin, does well.\nSo then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn’t give her in marriage does better.\nA wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whomever she desires, only in the Lord.\nBut she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God’s Spirit.\n",

His grace which was given to me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\nWhether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.\nNow if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?\nBut if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.\nIf Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.\nYes, we are also found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he didn’t raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised.\nFor if the dead aren’t raised, neither has Christ been raised.\nIf Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.\nThen they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.\nIf we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.\nBut now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the first fruits of those who are asleep.\nFor since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man.\nFor as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.\nBut each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s, at his coming.\nThen the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.\nFor he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.\nThe last enemy that will be abolished is death.\nFor, “He put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when he says, “All things are put in subjection”, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.\nWhen all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.\nOr else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren’t raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?\nWhy do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?\nI affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.\nIf I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”\nDon’t be deceived! “Evil companionships corrupt good morals.”\nWake up righteously, and don’t sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.\nBut someone will say, “How are the dead raised?” and, “With what kind of body do they come?”\nYou foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.\nThat which you sow, you don’t sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.\nBut God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.\nAll flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.\nThere are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.\nThere is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.\nSo also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown perishable; it is raised imperishable.\nIt is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.\nIt is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.\nSo also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.”\n The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.\nHowever that which is spiritual isn’t first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.\nThe first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.\nAs is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.\nAs we have borne the image of those made of dust, let’s also bear the image of the heavenly.\nNow I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can’t inherit God’s Kingdom; neither does the perishable inherit imperishable.\nBehold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,\nin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.\nFor this perishable body must become imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.\nBut when this perishable body will have become imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”\n“Death, where is your sting?\nHades, where is your victory?”\nThe sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.\nBut thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\nTherefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord’s work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.\n",

    "text_original": "Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you as crucified?\nI just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?\nAre you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?\nDid you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?\nHe therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and does miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?\nEven as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.”\nKnow therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.\nThe Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”\nSo then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.\nFor as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who doesn’t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.”\nNow that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”\nThe law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”\nChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,”\nthat the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.\nBrothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.\nNow the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. He doesn’t say, “To descendants”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”, which is Christ.\nNow I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.\nFor if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.\nThen why is there the law?

    "text_english": "Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you as crucified?\nI just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?\nAre you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?\nDid you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?\nHe therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and does miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?\nEven as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.”\nKnow therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.\nThe Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”\nSo then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.\nFor as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who doesn’t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.”\nNow that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”\nThe law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”\nChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,”\nthat the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.\nBrothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.\nNow the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. He doesn’t say, “To descendants”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”, which is Christ.\nNow I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.\nFor if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.\nThen why is there the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.\nNow a mediator is not between one, but God is one.\nIs the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.\nBut the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.\nBut before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.\nSo that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.\nBut now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.\nFor you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.\nFor as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.\nThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\nIf you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring and heirs according to promise.\n",

The demons also believe, and shudder.\nBut do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?\nWasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?\nYou see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;\nand the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness”; and he was called the friend of God.\nYou see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.\nIn the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?\nFor as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.\n",

I don’t say that he should make a request concerning this.\nAll unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.\nWe know that whoever is born of God doesn’t sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil one doesn’t touch him.\nWe know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.\nWe know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.\nLittle children, keep yourselves from idols.\n",
    "text_english": "Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. Whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him.\nBy this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.\nFor this is loving God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.\nFor whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: your faith.\nWho is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?\nThis is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.\nFor there are three who testify:\nthe Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one.\nIf we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is God’s testimony which he has testified concerning his Son.\nHe who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who doesn’t believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.\nThe testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.\nHe who has the Son has the life. He who doesn’t have God’s Son doesn’t have the life.\nThese things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.\nThis is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us.\nAnd if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.\nIf anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death.
