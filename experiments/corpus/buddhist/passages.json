    "text_english": "Long Discourses 1  The Divine Net  1. Talk on Wanderers  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.  The wanderer Suppiya was also traveling along the same road, together with his resident pupil, the student Brahmadatta.  Meanwhile, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways,  but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways.  And so both tutor and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other.  Then the Buddha took up residence for the night in the royal rest-house in Ambalaṭṭhikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.  And Suppiya and Brahmadatta did likewise.  There too, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways,  but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways.  And so both tutor and pupil kept on directly contradicting each other.  Then several mendicants rose at the crack of dawn and sat together in the pavilion, where the topic of judgmentalism came up:  “It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing how the diverse convictions of sentient beings have been well deciphered by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  For this Suppiya criticizes the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways,  while his pupil Brahmadatta praises them in many ways.  And so both tutor and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other.”  When the Buddha found out about this discussion on judgmentalism among the mendicants, he went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  The mendicants told him what had happened, adding,  “This was our conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.”  “Mendicants, if others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and exasperated.  You’ll get angry and upset, which would be an obstacle for you alone.  If others were to criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, and you got angry and upset, would you be able to understand whether they spoke well or poorly?”  “No, sir.”  “If others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should explain that what is untrue is in fact untrue:  ‘This is why that’s untrue, this is why that’s false. There’s no such thing in us, it’s not found among us.’  If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and excited.  You’ll get thrilled, elated, and excited, which would be an obstacle for you alone.  If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should admit that what is true is in fact true:  ‘This is why that’s true, this is why that’s correct. There is such a thing in us, it is found among us.’  2. Ethics  2.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics  When an ordinary person speaks praise of the Realized One, they speak only of trivial, trifling details of mere ethics.  And what are the trivial, trifling details of mere ethics that an ordinary person speaks of?  ‘The ascetic Gotama has given up killing living creatures. He has renounced the rod and the sword. He’s scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.’  Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.  ‘The ascetic Gotama has given up stealing. He takes only what’s given, and expects only what’s given. He keeps himself clean by not thieving.’  Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.  ‘The ascetic Gotama has given up unchastity. He is chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.’  Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.  ‘The ascetic Gotama has given up lying. He speaks the truth and sticks to the truth. He’s honest and dependable, and doesn’t trick the world with his words.’  Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.  ‘The ascetic Gotama has given up divisive speech. He doesn’t repeat in one place what he heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, he reconciles those who are divided and support those who are united, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.’  Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.  ‘The ascetic Gotama has given up harsh speech. He speaks in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.’  Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.  ‘The ascetic Gotama has given up talking nonsense. His words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. He says things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.’  Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.  ‘The ascetic Gotama refrains from injuring plants and seeds.’  ‘He eats in on",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 2  The Fruits of the Ascetic Life  1. A Discussion With the King’s Ministers  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.  Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudī full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth month—and King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse surrounded by his ministers.  Then Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, expressed this heartfelt sentiment,  “Oh, sirs, this moonlit night is so very delightful, so beautiful, so glorious, so lovely, so striking.  Now, what ascetic or brahmin might I pay homage to today, paying homage to whom my mind might find peace?”  When he had spoken, one of the king’s ministers said to him,  “Sire, Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.  Let Your Majesty pay homage to him.  Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.”  But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.  Another of the king’s ministers said to him,  “Sire, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.  Let Your Majesty pay homage to him.  Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.”  But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.  Another of the king’s ministers said to him,  “Sire, Ajita of the hair blanket leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.  Let Your Majesty pay homage to him.  Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.”  But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.  Another of the king’s ministers said to him,  “Sire, Pakudha Kaccāyana leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.  Let Your Majesty pay homage to him.  Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.”  But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.  Another of the king’s ministers said to him,  “Sire, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.  Let Your Majesty pay homage to him.  Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.”  But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.  Another of the king’s ministers said to him,  “Sire, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.  Let Your Majesty pay homage to him.  Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.”  But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.  2. A Discussion With Jīvaka Komārabhacca  Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king.  Then the king said to him,  “But my dear Jīvaka, why are you silent?”  “Sire, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying in my mango grove together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  Let Your Majesty pay homage to him.  Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.”  “Well then, my dear Jīvaka, have the elephants readied.”  “Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Jīvaka. He had around five hundred female elephants readied, in addition to the king’s bull elephant for riding. Then he informed the king,  “The elephants are ready, sire.  Please go at your convenience.”  Then King Ajātasattu had women mounted on each of the five hundred female elephants, while he mounted his bull elephant. With attendants carrying torches, he set out in full royal pomp from Rājagaha to Jīvaka’s mango grove.  But as he drew near the mango grove, the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end.  He said to Jīvaka,  “My dear Jīvaka, I hope you’re not deceiving me!  I hope you’re not betraying me!  I hope you’re not turning me over to my enemies!  For how on earth can th",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 3  With Ambaṭṭha  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala.  He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.  1. The Section on Pokkharasāti  Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti was living in Ukkaṭṭhā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.  Pokkharasāti heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  2. The Student Ambaṭṭha  Now at that time Pokkharasāti had a student named Ambaṭṭha as his resident pupil. He was one who recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered in the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. He had been authorized as a master in his own tutor’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas with the words:  “What I know, you know.  And what you know, I know.”  Then Pokkharasāti addressed Ambaṭṭha,  “Dear Ambaṭṭha, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby.  He has this good reputation …  It’s good to see such perfected ones.  Please, dear Ambaṭṭha, go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation.  Through you I shall learn about the worthy Gotama.”  “But sir, how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation?”  “Dear Ambaṭṭha, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.  If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.  He has the following seven treasures:  the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.  He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.  After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.  But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who has cast off the world’s veil.  But, dear Ambaṭṭha, I am the one who gives the hymns,  and you are the one who receives them.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied Ambaṭṭha. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Pokkharasāti, keeping him to his right. He mounted a chariot drawn by mares and, together with several young students, set out for the forest near Icchānaṅgala.  He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.  At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.  Then the student Ambaṭṭha went up to those mendicants and said,  “Good fellows, where is the worthy Gotama at present?  For we have come here to see him.”  Then those mendicants thought,  “This Ambaṭṭha is from a well-known family, and he is the pupil of the well-known brahmin Pokkharasāti.  The Buddha won’t mind having a discussion together with such gentlemen.”  They said to Ambaṭṭha,  “Ambaṭṭha, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the door-panel. The Buddha will open the door.”  So he approached the Buddha’s dwelling, cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel, and the Buddha opened the door.  Ambaṭṭha and the young students entered the dwelling. The young students exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, sat down to one side.  But while the Buddha was sitting, Ambaṭṭha spoke some polite words or other while walking around or standing.  So the Buddha said to him,  “Ambaṭṭha, is this how you hold a discussion with elderly and senior brahmins, the tutors of tutors: walking around ",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 4  With Soṇadaṇḍa  1. The Brahmins and Householders of Campā  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Aṅgas together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Campā,  where he stayed by the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.  Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living in Campā. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.  The brahmins and householders of Campā heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Then, exiting Campā, they formed into companies and headed to the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.  Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap.  He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the lotus pond,  and addressed his butler,  “My butler, why are the brahmins and householders headed for the Gaggarā Lotus Pond?”  “The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  They’re going to see that worthy Gotama.”  “Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them:  ‘Sirs, the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa asks  you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied the butler, and did as he was asked.  2. The Qualities of Soṇadaṇḍa  Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Campā on some business.  They heard that  the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was going to see the ascetic Gotama.  They approached Soṇadaṇḍa and said to him,  “Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?”  “Yes, gentlemen, it is true.”  “Please don’t, worthy Soṇadaṇḍa!  It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama.  For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will increase.  For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;  it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.  You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.  For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;  it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.  You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy. …  You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. You know them word-by-word, and their grammar. You are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. …  You are attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. You have divine looks and lustre, remarkable to behold. …  You are ethical, mature in ethical conduct. …  You’re a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. …  You tutor the tutors of many, and teach three hundred young students to recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns. …  You’re old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life.  The ascetic Gotama is young, and has newly gone forth. …  You’re honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha …  and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. …  You live in Campā, a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.  For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;  it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.”  3. The Qualities of the Buddha  When they had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins:  “Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it’s appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama,  and it’s not appropriate for him to come to see me.  He is well born on both his ",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 5  With Kūṭadanta  1. The Brahmins and Householders of Khāṇumata  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Magadhan brahmins named Khāṇumata.  There he stayed nearby at Ambalaṭṭhikā.  Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta was living in Khāṇumata. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.  Now at that time Kūṭadanta had prepared a great sacrifice.  Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams—seven hundred of each—had been led to the post for the sacrifice.  The brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Then, exiting Khāṇumata, they formed into companies and headed to Ambalaṭṭhikā.  Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap.  He saw the brahmins and householders heading for Ambalaṭṭhikā,  and addressed his butler,  “My butler, why are the brahmins and householders headed for Ambalaṭṭhikā?”  “The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  They’re going to see that worthy Gotama.”  Then Kūṭadanta thought,  “I’ve heard that  the ascetic Gotama knows how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories.  I don’t know about that,  but I wish to perform a great sacrifice.  Why don’t I ask him how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories?”  Then Kūṭadanta addressed his butler,  “Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them:  ‘Sirs, the brahmin Kūṭadanta asks  you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied the butler, and did as he was asked.  2. The Qualities of Kūṭadanta  Now at that time several hundred brahmins were residing in Khāṇumata  thinking to participate in Kūṭadanta’s sacrifice.  They heard that  Kūṭadanta was going to see the ascetic Gotama.  They approached Kūṭadanta and said to him:  “Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?”  “Yes, gentlemen, it is true.”  “Please don’t!  It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama.  For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will increase.  For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;  it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.  You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.  For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;  it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.  You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain …  You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. You know them word-by-word, and their grammar. You are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. …  You are attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. You have divine looks and lustre, remarkable to behold. …  You are ethical, mature in ethical conduct. …  You’re a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. …  You teach the tutors of many, and teach three hundred young students to recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns. …  You’re old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life.  The ascetic Gotama is young, and has newly gone forth. …  You’re honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha …  and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. …  You live in Khāṇumata, ",

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.  Now at that time several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were residing in Vesālī on some business.  They heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.

It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Then they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood to see the Buddha.  Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant.  The brahmin emissaries went up to him and said,  “Worthy Nāgita, where is the worthy Gotama at present?  For we want to see him.”  “It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha; he is on retreat.”  So right there the brahmin emissaries sat down to one side, thinking,  “We’ll go only after we’ve seen the worthy Gotama.”  2. On Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi  Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also approached Nāgita at the hall with the peaked roof. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita,  “Worthy Nāgita, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?  For we want to see him.”  “It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha; he is on retreat.”  So right there Oṭṭhaddha also sat down to one side, thinking,  “I’ll go only after I’ve seen the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”  Then the novice Sīha approached Nāgita. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita,  “Honorable Kassapa, these several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha, and also Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis, have come here to see the Buddha. It’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.”  “Well then, Sīha, tell the Buddha yourself.”  “Yes, sir,” replied Sīha. He went to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of the people waiting to see him, adding:  “Sir, it’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.”  “Well then, Sīha, spread out a seat in the shade of the dwelling.”  “Yes, sir,” replied Sīha, and he did so.  Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and sat in the shade of the dwelling on the seat spread out.  Then the brahmin emissaries went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side.  Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Oṭṭhaddha said to the Buddha, “Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said:  ‘Mahāli, soon I will have been living in dependence on the Buddha for three years. I see heavenly sights that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing, but I don’t hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing.’  The heavenly sounds that Sunakkhatta cannot hear: do such sounds really exist or not?”  2.1. One-Sided Immersion  “Such sounds really do exist, but Sunakkhatta cannot hear them.”  “What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear them, even though they really do exist?”  “Mahāli, take a mendicant who has developed immersion to the eastern quarter in one aspect: so as to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly sounds.  When they have developed immersion for that purpose,  they see heavenly sights but don’t hear heavenly sounds.  Why is that?  Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way.  Furthermore, take a mendicant who has developed immersion to the southern quarter in one aspect …  western quarter …  northern quarter …  above, below, across …  That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way.

Now at that time two renunciates— the wanderer Muṇḍiya and Jāliya, the pupil of the wood-bowl ascetic—came to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said to the Buddha,  “Reverend Gotama, are the soul and the body one and the same, or is the soul one thing, the body another?”  “Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, reverend,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Take the case when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …  That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. …  They enter and remain in the first absorption …  When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them:  ‘The soul and the body are one and the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body another’?”  “It would, reverend.”  “But reverends, I know and see like this.  Nevertheless, I do not say:  ‘The soul and the body are one and the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body another’. …  They enter and remain in the second absorption …  third absorption …  fourth absorption.

Nevertheless, I do not say:  ‘The soul and the body are one and the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body another’. …  They project and extend the mind toward knowledge and vision …  When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them:  ‘The soul and the body are one and the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body another’?”  “It would, reverend.”  “But reverends, I know and see like this.  Nevertheless, I do not say:  ‘The soul and the body are one and the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body another’. …  They understand: ‘… there is nothing further for this place.’  When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them:  ‘The soul and the body are one and the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body another’?”  “It would not, reverend.”  “But reverends, I know and see like this.  Nevertheless, I do not say:  ‘The soul and the body are one and the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body another’.”  That is what the Buddha said.  Satisfied, the two renunciates approved what the Buddha said. ",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 8  The Lion’s Roar to the Naked Ascetic Kassapa  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuññā, in the deer park at Kaṇṇakatthala.  Then the naked ascetic Kassapa went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side and said to the Buddha:  “Worthy Gotama, I have heard the following:  ‘The ascetic Gotama criticizes all fervent mortification. He categorically condemns and denounces all fervent mortifiers who live rough.’  Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?  For we don’t want to misrepresent the worthy Gotama.”  “Kassapa, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false, baseless, and untrue.  With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see some fervent mortifier who lives rough reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.  But I see another fervent mortifier who lives rough reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.  I see some fervent mortifier who takes it easy reborn in a place of loss.  But I see another fervent mortifier who takes it easy reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.  Since I truly understand the coming and going, passing away and rebirth of these fervent mortifiers in this way, how could I criticize all forms of mortification, or categorically condemn and denounce those fervent mortifiers who live rough?  There are some clever ascetics and brahmins who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect.  They agree with me in some matters and disagree in others.  Some of the things that they applaud, I also applaud.  Some of the things that they don’t applaud, I also don’t applaud.  But some of the things that they applaud, I don’t applaud.  And some of the things that they don’t applaud, I do applaud.  Some of the things that I applaud, others also applaud.  Some of the things that I don’t applaud, they also don’t applaud.  But some of the things that I don’t applaud, others do applaud.  And some of the things that I do applaud, others don’t applaud.  1. Examination  I go up to them and say:  ‘Let us leave aside those matters on which we disagree.  But there are some matters on which we agree. Regarding these, sensible people, pursuing, pressing, and grilling, would compare teacher with teacher or community with community:  “There are things that are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones, and dark—and are reckoned as such.  Who proceeds having totally given these things up: the ascetic Gotama, or the tutors of other communities?”’  It’s possible that they might say:  ‘The ascetic Gotama proceeds having totally given those unskillful things up, compared with the tutors of other communities.’  And that’s how, when sensible people pursue the matter, they will mostly praise us.  In addition, sensible people, pursuing, pressing, and grilling, would compare teacher with teacher or community with community:  ‘There are things that are skillful, blameless, worth cultivating, worthy of the noble ones, and bright—and are reckoned as such.

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 9  With Poṭṭhapāda  1. On the Wanderer Poṭṭhapāda  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was residing together with three hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for philosophical debates, hedged by pale-moon ebony trees.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.  Then it occurred to him,  “It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī.  Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda?”  So that’s what he did.  Now at that time, Poṭṭhapāda was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a colossal racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as  talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that place.  Poṭṭhapāda saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,  and hushed his own assembly,  “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.  Here comes the ascetic Gotama.  The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.  Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”  Then those wanderers fell silent.  Then the Buddha approached Poṭṭhapāda,  who said to him,  “Let the Blessed One come, sir!  Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!  It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.  Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,  while Poṭṭhapāda took a low seat and sat to one side.  The Buddha said to him,  “Poṭṭhapāda, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  1.1. On the Cessation of Perception  When he said this, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha,  “Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.  It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.  Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions were sitting together at the debating hall, and a discussion about the cessation of perception came up among them:  ‘How does the cessation of perception happen?’  Some of them said:  ‘A person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason.  When they arise, you become percipient.  When they cease, you become non-percipient.’  That’s how some describe the cessation of perception.  But someone else says:  ‘That’s not how it is, good fellows!  Perception is a person’s self,  which enters and departs.  When it enters, you become percipient.  When it departs, you become non-percipient.’  That’s how some describe the cessation of perception.  But someone else says:  ‘That’s not how it is, good fellows!  There are ascetics and brahmins of great power and might.  They insert and extract a person’s perception.  When they insert it, you become percipient.  When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’  That’s how some describe the cessation of perception.  But someone else says:  ‘That’s not how it is, good fellows!  There are deities of great power and might.  They insert and extract a person’s perception.  When they insert it, you become percipient.  When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’  That’s how some describe the cessation of perception.  That reminded me of the Buddha:  ‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so very skilled in such matters.’  The Buddha is skilled and well-versed concerning the cessation of perception.  How does the cessation of perception happen?”  1.2. Perception Arises With a Cause  “Regarding this, Poṭṭhapāda, those ascetics and brahmins who say that  a person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason are wrong from the start.  Why is that?  Because a person’s perceptions arise and cease with cause and reason.  With training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease.  And what is that training?” said the Buddha.  “It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …  That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. …  Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed.  Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.  The sensual perception that they had previously ceases.  At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion.  That’s ",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 10  With Subha  So I have heard.  At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. It was not long after the Buddha had become fully quenched.  Now at that time the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, was residing in Sāvatthī on some business.  Then he addressed a certain young student,  “Here, young student, go to the ascetic Ānanda and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  And then say:  ‘Sir, please visit the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, at his home out of sympathy.’”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied the young student, and did as he was asked.  When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to him,  “It’s not the right time, young student.  I have drunk a dose of medicine today.  But hopefully tomorrow I’ll get a chance to visit him.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied the young student. He went back to Subha, and told him what had happened, adding,  “This much, sir, I managed to do. At least the worthy Ānanda will take the opportunity to visit tomorrow.”  Then when the night had passed, Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Cetaka as his second monk to Subha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Subha went up to Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda:  “Worthy Ānanda, you were the worthy Gotama’s attendant. You were close to him, living in his presence.  You ought to know what things the worthy Gotama praised, and in which he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people.  What were those things?”  “Student, the Buddha praised three spectrums of practice, and that’s what he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people in.  What three?  The entire spectrum of noble ethics, immersion, and wisdom.  These are the three  spectrums of practice that the Buddha praised.”  1. The Entire Spectrum of Ethics  “But what was that entire spectrum of noble ethics that the Buddha praised?”  “Student, it’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.  They gain faith in the Realized One  and reflect:  ‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.  It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.  Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’  After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.  Once they’ve gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content.  And how is a mendicant accomplished in ethics?  It’s when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings. …  This pertains to their ethics.  There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still earn a living by low lore, by wrong livelihood.  This includes rites for propitiation, for granting wishes, for ghosts, for the earth, for rain, for property settlement, and for preparing and consecrating house sites, and rites involving sipping water and bathing, and oblations. It also includes administering emetics, purgatives, expectorants, and phlegmagogues; administering ear-oils, eye restoratives, nasal medicine, ointments, and counter-ointments; surgery with needle and scalpel, treating children, prescribing root medicines, and herbal bandages.  They refrain from such low lore, such wrong livelihood. …  This pertains to their ethics.  A mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint.  It’s like a king who has defeated his enemies. He sees no danger from his foes in any quarter.  A mendicant thus accomplished",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 11  With Kevaḍḍha  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.  Then the householder Kevaḍḍha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, this Nāḷandā is successful and prosperous, populous, full of people.  Please direct a mendicant to perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power.  Then Nāḷandā will become even more devoted to the Buddha!”  When he said this, the Buddha said,  “Kevaḍḍha, I do not teach Dhamma to the mendicants like this:  ‘Come now, mendicants, perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for the white-clothed laypeople.’”  For a second time, Kevaḍḍha made the same request,  “Sir, I am not teaching you the Dhamma,  but nonetheless I say:  ‘Sir, this Nāḷandā is successful and prosperous, populous, full of people.  Please direct a mendicant to perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power.  Then Nāḷandā will become even more devoted to the Buddha!’”  But for a second time, the Buddha gave the same answer.  For a third time, Kevaḍḍha made the same request,  at which the Buddha said the following.  1. The Demonstration of Psychic Power  “Kevaḍḍha, there are three kinds of demonstration, which I declare having realized them with my own insight.  What three?  The demonstration of psychic power, the demonstration of revealing, and the demonstration of instruction.  And what is the demonstration of psychic power?  It’s a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; materializing and dematerializing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.  Someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant performing those superhuman feats.  They tell someone else who lacks faith and confidence:  ‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might!  I saw him myself, performing all these superhuman feats!’  But the one lacking faith and confidence would say to them:  ‘There’s a spell named Gandhārī.  Using that a mendicant can perform such superhuman feats.’  What do you think, Kevaḍḍha?  Wouldn’t someone lacking faith speak like that?”  “They would, sir.”  “Seeing this drawback in psychic power, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by demonstrations of psychic power.  2. The Demonstration of Revealing  And what is the demonstration of revealing?  It’s when a mendicant reveals the mind, mentality, thoughts, and reflections of other beings and individuals:  ‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’  Someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant revealing another individual’s thoughts.  They tell someone else who lacks faith and confidence:  ‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might!  I saw him myself, revealing the thoughts of another individual!’  But the one lacking faith and confidence would say to them:  ‘There’s a spell named Māṇikā.  Using that a mendicant can reveal another individual’s thoughts.’  What do you think, Kevaḍḍha?  Wouldn’t someone lacking faith speak like that?”  “They would, sir.”  “Seeing this drawback in revealing, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by demonstrations of revealing.  3. The Demonstration of Instruction  And what is the demonstration of instruction?  It’s when a mendicant instructs others like this:  ‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’  This is called the demonstration of instruction.  Furthermore, a Realized One arises in the world …  That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. …  They enter and remain in the first absorption …  This is called the demonstration of instruction.  They enter and remain in the second absorption …  third absorption …  fourth absorption.  This too is called the demonstration of instruction.  They project and extend the mind toward knowledge and vision …  This too is called the demonstration of instruction.  They understand: ‘… there is nothing further for this place.’  This too is called the demonstration of instruction.  These, Kevaḍḍha, are the three kinds of demonstration, which I declare having realized them with my own insight.  4. On the Mendicant in Search of the Cessation of Being  Once upon a time, Kevaḍḍha, a mendicant in this very Saṅgha had the following thought,  ‘Where do these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’  Then that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to the gods appeared.  Then he approached the gods of the four great kings and said,  ‘",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 12  With Lohicca  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Sālavatikā.  Now at that time the brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.  Now at that time Lohicca had the following harmful misconception:  “Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another?  Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond.  That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?”  Lohicca heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Sālavatikā, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Then Lohicca addressed his barber Rosika,  “Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  And then ask him whether he,  together with the mendicant Saṅgha, might please accept tomorrow’s meal from the brahmin Lohicca.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked, and  the Buddha consented with silence.  Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Rosika got up from his seat, went to Lohicca, and said to him,  “I gave the Buddha your message,  and he accepted.”  And when the night had passed Lohicca had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,  “Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and announce the time, saying:  ‘It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.’”  “Yes, worthy sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sālavatikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.  Now, Rosika was following behind the Buddha,  and told him of Lohicca’s views, adding,  “Sir, please dissuade him from that harmful misconception.”  “Hopefully that’ll happen, Rosika, hopefully that’ll happen.”  Then the Buddha approached Lohicca’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out.  Then Lohicca served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.  1. Questioning Lohicca  When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Lohicca took a low seat and sat to one side.  The Buddha said to him,  “Is it really true, Lohicca, that you have such a harmful misconception:  ‘Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another?  Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond.  That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’”  “Yes, worthy Gotama.”  “What do you think, Lohicca?  Do you reside in Sālavatikā?”  “Yes, worthy Gotama.”  “Lohicca, suppose someone were to say:  ‘The brahmin Lohicca resides in Sālavatikā.  He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Sālavatikā and not share them with anyone else.’  Would the one who spoke like that make it difficult for those whose living depends on you or not?”  “They would, worthy Gotama.”  “But is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindly?”  “Unkindly, sir.”  “But does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostility?”  “Hostility, sir.”  “And when the heart is full of hostility, is there right view or wrong view?”  “Wrong view, worthy Gotama.”  “An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say:  hell or the animal realm.  What do you think, Lohicca?  Does King Pasenadi reign over Kāsi and Kosala?”  “Yes, worthy Gotama.”  “Lohicca, suppose someone were to say:  ‘King Pasenadi reigns over Kāsi and Kosala.  He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Kāsi and Kosala and not share them with anyone else.’  Would the one who spoke like that make it difficult for yourself and others whose living depends on King Pasenadi or not?”  “They would, worthy Gotama.”  “But is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 13  Experts in the Three Vedas  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Manasākaṭa.  He stayed in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa.  Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Manasākaṭa. They included  the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.  Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began a discussion regarding what is the path and what is not the path.  Vāseṭṭha said this:  “This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity; namely, that explained by the brahmin Pokkharasāti.”  Bhāradvāja said this:  “This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity; namely, that explained by the brahmin Tārukkha.”  But neither was able to persuade the other.  So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja,  “Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter.  As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied Bhāradvāja.  1. What is the Path and What is Not the Path  So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and Vāseṭṭha told him of their conversation, adding:  “In this matter we have a dispute, a disagreement, a difference of opinion.”  “So, Vāseṭṭha, it seems that you say that  the straight path is that explained by Pokkharasāti,  while Bhāradvāja says that  the straight path is that explained by Tārukkha.  But what exactly is your disagreement about?”  “About what is the path and what is not the path, worthy Gotama.  Even though brahmins describe different paths—the Adhvaryu brahmins, the Taittirīya brahmins, the Chāndogya brahmins, the Cāndrāyaṇa brahmins, and the Bahvṛca brahmins—all of them still lead someone who practices them to the company of Divinity.  It’s like a village or town that has many different roads nearby, yet all of them meet at that village.  In the same way, even though brahmins describe different paths—the Adhvaryu brahmins, the Taittirīya brahmins, the Chāndogya brahmins, the Cāndrāyaṇa brahmins, and the Bahvṛca brahmins—all of them still lead someone who practices them to the company of Divinity.”  2. Questioning Vāseṭṭha  “Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?”  “I do, worthy Gotama.”  “Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?”  “I do, worthy Gotama.”  “Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?”  “I do, worthy Gotama.”  “Well, of the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas, Vāseṭṭha, is there even a single one who has seen the Divinity with their own eyes?”  “No, worthy Gotama.”  “Well, has even a single one of their tutors seen the Divinity with their own eyes?”  “No, worthy Gotama.”  “Well, has even a single one of their tutors’ tutors seen the Divinity with their own eyes?”  “No, worthy Gotama.”  “Well, has anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors seen the Divinity with their own eyes?”  “No, worthy Gotama.”  “Well, what of the ancient seers of the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught.  Did they say:  ‘We know and see where the Divinity is or what way he lies’?”  “No, worthy Gotama.”  “So it seems that none of those brahmins have seen the Divinity with their own eyes,  and not even the ancient seers  claimed to know where he is.  Yet the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas say:  ‘We teach the path to the company of that which we neither know nor see.  This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity.’  What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?  This being so, doesn’t their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?”  “Clearly that’s the case, worthy Gotama.”  “Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see.  Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.  In the same way",

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, in the hut by the kareri tree.  Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the pavilion by the kareri tree and this Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives came up among them,  “So it was in a past life; such it was in a past life.”  With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard that discussion among the mendicants.  So he got up from his seat and went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  The mendicants told him what had happened, adding,  “This is the conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.”  “Would you like to hear a Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives?”  “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!  Let the Buddha give a Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”  “Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Ninety-one eons ago, the Buddha Vipassī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.  Thirty-one eons ago, the Buddha Sikhī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.  In the same thirty-first eon, the Buddha Vessabhū arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.  In the present fortunate eon, the Buddhas Kakusandha,  Koṇāgamana,  and Kassapa arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.  And in the present fortunate eon, I have arisen in the world, perfected and fully awakened.  The Buddhas Vipassī,  Sikhī,  and Vessabhū were born as aristocrats into aristocrat families.  The Buddhas Kakusandha,  Koṇāgamana,  and Kassapa were born as brahmins into brahmin families.  I was born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family.  Koṇḍañña was the clan of Vipassī,  Sikhī,  and Vessabhū.  Kassapa was the clan of Kakusandha,  Koṇāgamana,  and Kassapa.  Gotama is my clan.  For Vipassī, the lifespan was 80,000 years.  For Sikhī, the lifespan was 70,000 years.  For Vessabhū, the lifespan was 60,000 years.  For Kakusandha, the lifespan was 40,000 years.  For Koṇāgamana, the lifespan was 30,000 years.  For Kassapa, the lifespan was 20,000 years.  For me at this time the life-span is short, brief, and fleeting. A long life is a hundred years or a little more.  Vipassī was awakened at the root of a patala tree.  Sikhī was awakened at the root of a white-mango tree.  Vessabhū was awakened at the root of a sal tree.  Kakusandha was awakened at the root of a lebbeck tree.  Koṇāgamana was awakened at the root of a cluster fig tree.  Kassapa was awakened at the root of a banyan tree.  I was awakened at the root of a peepal tree.  Vipassī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Khaṇḍa and Tissa.  Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava.  Vessabhū had a fine pair of chief disciples named Soṇa and Uttara.  Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva.  Koṇāgamana had a fine pair of chief disciples named Bhiyyosa and Uttara.  Kassapa had a fine pair of chief disciples named Tissa and Bhāradvāja.  I have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna.  Vipassī had three gatherings of disciples—one of 6,800,000, one of 100,000, and one of 80,000—all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements.  Sikhī had three gatherings of disciples—one of 100,000, one of 80,000, and one of 70,000—all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements.  Vessabhū had three gatherings of disciples—one of 80,000, one of 70,000, and one of 60,000—all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements.  Kakusandha had one gathering of disciples—40,000 mendicants who had ended their defilements.  Koṇāgamana had one gathering of disciples—30,000 mendicants who had ended their defilements.  Kassapa had one gathering of disciples—20,000 mendicants who had ended their defilements.  I have had one gathering of disciples—1,250 mendicants who had ended their defilements.  Vipassī had as chief attendant a mendicant named Asoka.  Sikhī had as chief attendant a mendicant named Khemaṅkara.  Vessabhū had as chief attendant a mendicant named Upasanta.  Kakusandha had as chief attendant a mendicant named Buddhija.  Koṇāgamana had as chief attendant a mendicant named Sotthija.  Kassapa had as chief attendant a mendicant named Sabbamitta.  I have as chief attendant a mendicant named Ānanda.  Vipassī’s father was King Bandhumā,  his birth mother was Queen Bandhumatī,  and their capital city was named Bandhumatī.  Sikhī’s father was King Aruṇa,  his birth mother was Queen Pabhāvatī,  and their capital city was named Aruṇavatī.  Vessabhū’s father was King Suppatita,  his birth mother was Queen Vassavatī,  and their capital",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 15  The Great Discourse on Causation  1. Dependent Origination  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.  Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,  in that this dependent origination is deep and appears deep, yet to me it seems as plain as can be.”  “Don’t say that, Ānanda, don’t say that!  This dependent origination is deep and appears deep.  It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population has become tangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, and it doesn’t escape the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.  When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for old age and death?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’  If they say, ‘What is a requirement for old age and death?’ you should answer, ‘Rebirth is a requirement for old age and death.’  When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for rebirth?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’  If they say, ‘What is a requirement for rebirth?’ you should answer, ‘Continued existence is a requirement for rebirth.’  When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for continued existence?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’  If they say, ‘What is a requirement for continued existence?’ you should answer, ‘Grasping is a requirement for continued existence.’  When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for grasping?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’  If they say, ‘What is a requirement for grasping?’ you should answer, ‘Craving is a requirement for grasping.’  When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for craving?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’  If they say, ‘What is a requirement for craving?’ you should answer, ‘Feeling is a requirement for craving.’  When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for feeling?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’  If they say, ‘What is a requirement for feeling?’ you should answer, ‘Contact is a requirement for feeling.’  When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for contact?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’  If they say, ‘What is a requirement for contact?’ you should answer, ‘Name and form are requirements for contact.’  When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for name and form?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’  If they say, ‘What is a requirement for name and form?’ you should answer, ‘Consciousness is a requirement for name and form.’  When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for consciousness?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’  If they say, ‘What is a requirement for consciousness?’ you should answer, ‘Name and form are requirements for consciousness.’  So: name and form are requirements for consciousness. Consciousness is a requirement for name and form. Name and form are requirements for contact. Contact is a requirement for feeling. Feeling is a requirement for craving. Craving is a requirement for grasping. Grasping is a requirement for continued existence. Continued existence is a requirement for rebirth. Rebirth is a requirement for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.  That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.  ‘Rebirth is a requirement for old age and death’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.  Suppose there were totally and utterly no rebirth for anyone anywhere.  That is, there were no rebirth of sentient beings into their various realms—of gods, centaurs, spirits, creatures, humans, quadrupeds, birds, or reptiles, each into their own realm. When there’s no rebirth at all, with the cessation of rebirth, would old age and death still be found?”  “No, sir.”  “That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of old age and death, namely rebirth.  ‘Continued existence is a requirement for rebirth’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.  Suppose there were totally and utterly no continued existence for anyone anywhere.  That is, continued existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, or the formless realm. When there’s no continued existence at all, with the cessation of continued existence, would rebirth still be found?”  “No, sir.”  “That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of rebirth, namely continued existence.  ‘Grasping is a requirement for continued existence’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.  Suppose there were totally and utterly no grasping for anyone anywhere.  That is, grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self. When there’s no grasping at all, with the cessation of grasping, would continued existence still be found?”  “No, sir.”  “That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of continued existence, namely grasping.  ‘Craving is a requirement for grasping’—that’s what I said.

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 16  The Great Discourse on the Buddha’s Extinguishment  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.  Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, wanted to invade the Vajjis.  He declared:  “I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!”  And then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra the brahmin minister of Magadha,  “Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  And then say:  ‘Sir, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, wants to invade the Vajjis.  He says,  “I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!”’  Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me.  For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so.”  1. The Brahmin Vassakāra  “Yes, worthy sir,” Vassakāra replied. He had the finest carriages harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Rājagaha for the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.  He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,  “Worthy Gotama, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  Worthy Gotama, King Ajātasattu wants to invade the Vajjis.  He has declared:  ‘I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!’”  2. Principles That Prevent Decline  Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.  Then the Buddha said to him,  “Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings?”  “I have heard that, sir.”  “As long as the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect growth, not decline.  Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony?”  “I have heard that, sir.”  “As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.  Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as they have been decreed?”  “I have heard that, sir.”  “As long as the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as they have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.  Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to?”  “I have heard that, sir.”  “As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not decline.  Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t forcibly abduct the women or girls of the clans and make them live with them?”  “I have heard that, sir.”  “As long as the Vajjis don’t forcibly abduct the women or girls of the clans and make them live with them, they can expect growth, not decline.  Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past?”  “I have heard that, sir.”  “As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect growth, not decline.  Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort?”  “I have heard that, sir.”  “As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not decline.”  Then the Buddha said to Vassakāra,  “Brahmin, this one time I was staying near Vesālī at the Sārandada Shrine.  There I taught the Vajjis these seven principles that prevent decline.  As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline.”  When the Buddha had spoken, Vassakāra said to him,  “Worthy Gotama, if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they can expect growth, not decline.  How much more so all seven!  King Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 17  King Mahāsudassana  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his full extinguishment.  Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, please don’t be fully extinguished in this little hamlet, this jungle hamlet, this branch hamlet.  There are other great cities such as  Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī, and Varanasi.  Let the Buddha be fully extinguished there.  There are many well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, and householders there who are devoted to the Buddha. They will perform the rites of venerating the Realized One’s corpse.”  “Don’t say that, Ānanda! Don’t say that  this is a little hamlet, a jungle hamlet, a branch hamlet.  1. The Capital City of Kusāvatī  Once upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana whose dominion extended to all four sides, and who achieved stability in the country.  His capital was this Kusinārā, which at the time was named Kusāvatī.  It stretched for twelve leagues from east to west, and seven leagues from north to south.  The royal capital of Kusāvatī was successful, prosperous, populous, full of people, with plenty of food.  It was just like Āḷakamandā, the royal capital of the gods, which is successful, prosperous, populous, full of spirits, with plenty of food.  Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night, namely:  the sound of elephants, horses, chariots, drums, clay drums, arched harps, singing, horns, gongs, and handbells; and the cry, ‘Eat, drink, be merry!’ as the tenth.  Kusāvatī was encircled by seven ramparts:  one made of gold, one made of silver, one made of beryl, one made of crystal, one made of ruby, one made of emerald, and one made of all precious things.  It had four gates,  made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.  At each gate there were seven pillars, three fathoms deep and four fathoms high,  made of gold, silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all precious things.  It was surrounded by seven rows of palm trees,  made of gold, silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all precious things.  The golden palms had trunks of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver.  The silver palms had trunks of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold.  The beryl palms had trunks of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal.  The crystal palms had trunks of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl.  The ruby palms had trunks of ruby, and leaves and fruits of emerald.  The emerald palms had trunks of emerald, and leaves and fruits of ruby.  The palms of all precious things had trunks of all precious things, and leaves and fruits of all precious things.  When those rows of palm trees were blown by the wind they sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating,  like a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept excellent rhythm.  And any addicts, carousers, or drunkards in Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that sound.  2. The Seven Treasures  2.1. The Wheel-Treasure  King Mahāsudassana possessed seven treasures and four blessings.  What seven?  On a fifteenth day sabbath, King Mahāsudassana had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath.  And the heavenly wheel-treasure appeared to him, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.  Seeing this, the king thought,  ‘I have heard that when the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.  Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?’  Then King Mahāsudassana, rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder, took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying:  ‘Roll forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!’  Then the wheel-treasure rolled towards the east. And the king followed it together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army.  And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to him and said,  ‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’  The king said,  ‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the current level of taxation.’  And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter became his vassals.  Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolled towards the south. …  Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the west. …  Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the north, followed by the king together with his army of four divisions.  In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army.  And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came ",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 18  With Janavasabha  1. Declaring the Rebirths of People From Ñātika and Elsewhere  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick house.  Now at that time the Buddha was explaining the rebirths of devotees all over the nations; the Kāsis and Kosalans, Vajjis and Mallas, Cetīs and Vacchas, Kurus and Pañcālas, Macchas and Sūrasenas:  “This one was reborn here, while that one was reborn there.  Over fifty devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.  More than ninety devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They’re once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.  More than five hundred devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, destined for awakening.”  When the devotees of Ñātika heard about the Buddha’s  answers to those questions, they became uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness.  Venerable Ānanda heard of the Buddha’s statements and the Ñātikans’ happiness.  2. Ānanda’s Suggestion  Then Venerable Ānanda thought,  “But there were also Magadhan devotees—many, and of long standing too—who have passed away.  You’d think that Aṅga and Magadha were empty of devotees who have passed away!  But they too had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled their ethics.  The Buddha hasn’t declared their passing.  It would be good to do so, for many people would gain confidence, and so be reborn in a good place.  That King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was a just and principled king who benefited the brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.  People still sing his praises:  ‘That just and principled king, who made us so happy, has passed away. Life was good under his dominion.’  He too had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled his ethics.  People say:  ‘Until his dying day, King Bimbisāra sang the Buddha’s praises!’  The Buddha hasn’t declared his passing.  It would be good to do so, for many people would gain confidence, and so be reborn in a good place.  Besides, the Buddha was awakened in Magadha;  so why hasn’t he declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees?  If he fails to do so, they will be dejected.”  After pondering the fate of the Magadhan devotees alone in private, Ānanda rose at the crack of dawn and went to see the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his concerns, finishing by saying,  “Why hasn’t the Buddha declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees? If he fails to do so, they will be dejected.”  Then Ānanda, after making this suggestion regarding the Magadhan devotees, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.  Soon after Ānanda had left, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Ñātika for alms.  He wandered for alms in Ñātika. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he washed his feet and entered the brick house. He paid attention, applied the mind, and concentrated wholeheartedly on the fate of Magadhan devotees, and sat on the seat spread out, thinking,  “I shall know their destiny, where they are reborn in the next life.”  And he saw where they had been reborn.  Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat. Emerging from the brick house, he sat on the seat spread out in the shade of the porch.  Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, you look so serene; your face seems to shine owing to the clarity of your faculties.  Have you been abiding in a peaceful meditation today, sir?”  The Buddha then recounted what had happened since speaking to Ānanda, revealing that he had seen the destiny of the Magadhan devotees. He continued:  3. Janavasabha the Spirit  “Then, Ānanda, an invisible spirit called out:  ‘I am Janavasabha, Blessed One!  I am Janavasabha, Holy One!’  Ānanda, do you recall having previously heard such a name as Janavasabha?”  “No, worthy sir. But when I heard the word, I got goosebumps!  I thought,  ‘This must be no ordinary spirit to bear such an exalted name as Janavasabha.’”  “After making himself heard while vanished, Ānanda, a very beautiful spirit appeared in front of me.  And for a second time he called out:  ‘I am Bimbisāra, Blessed One!  I am Bimbisāra, Holy One!  This is the seventh time I am reborn in the company of the Great King Vessavaṇa. When I pass away from here, I can become a king of men.  Seven from here, seven from there— fourteen transmigrations in all.  I remember these lives  where I lived before.  For a long time I’ve known that I won’t be reborn in the underworld, but that I still hope to become a o",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 19  The Great Steward  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.  Then, late at night, the centaur Pañcasikha, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, I would tell you of what I heard and learned directly from the gods of the thirty-three.”  “Tell me, Pañcasikha,” said the Buddha.  1. The Council of the Gods  “Sir, it was more than a few days ago—on the fifteenth day sabbath on the full moon day at the invitation to admonish held at the end of the rainy season—when all the gods of the thirty-three were sitting together in the Hall of Clear Right.  A large assembly of gods was sitting all around, and the four great kings were seated at the four quarters.  The Great King Dhataraṭṭha was seated to the east, facing west, in front of his gods.  The Great King Virūḷhaka was seated to the south, facing north, in front of his gods.  The Great King Virūpakkha was seated to the west, facing east, in front of his gods.  The Great King Vessavaṇa was seated to the north, facing south, in front of his gods.  When the gods of the thirty-three have a gathering like this, that is how they are seated.  After that come our seats.  Sir, those gods who had been recently reborn in the company of the thirty-three after leading the spiritual life under the Buddha outshine the other gods in beauty and glory.  The gods of the thirty-three became uplifted and overjoyed at that, full of rapture and happiness, saying,  ‘The heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle!’  Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, celebrated with these verses:  ‘The gods rejoice— the thirty-three with their Lord— revering the Realized One,  and the clear rightness of the teaching;  and seeing the new gods,  so beautiful and glorious,  who have come here after leading  the spiritual life under the Buddha!  They outshine the others  in beauty, glory, and lifespan.  Here are the distinguished disciples  of he whose wisdom is vast.  Seeing this, they delight— the thirty-three with their Lord— revering the Realized One,  and the clear rightness of the teaching!’  The gods of the thirty-three became even more uplifted and overjoyed at that, full of rapture and happiness, saying,  ‘The heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle!’  2. Eight Genuine Praises  Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed them,  ‘Gentlemen, would you like to hear eight genuine praises of the Buddha?’  ‘Indeed we would, sir.’  Then Sakka proffered these eight genuine praises of the Buddha:  ‘What do the good gods of the thirty-three think?  How the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!  I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who has such sympathy for the world, apart from the Buddha.  Also, the Buddha has explained the teaching well—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.  I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who explains such a relevant teaching, apart from the Buddha.  Also, the Buddha has well described what is skillful and what is unskillful,  what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, what is inferior and what is superior, and what is on the side of dark and the side of bright.  I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly describes all these things, apart from the Buddha.  Also, the Buddha has well described the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples. And extinguishment converges with the practice,  as the waters of the Ganges join together and converge with the waters of the Yamuna.  I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly describes the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples, apart from the Buddha.  Also, possessions and popularity have accrued to the Buddha, so much that you’d think it would thrill even the aristocrats. But he takes his food free of vanity.  I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who takes their food so free of vanity, apart from the Buddha.  Also, the Buddha has gained companions, both trainees who are practicing, and those with defilements ended who have completed their journey.  The Buddha is committed to the joy of solitude, but doesn’t send them away.  I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, so committed to the joy of solitude, apart from the Buddha.  Also, the Buddha does as he says, and says as he does, thus: he does as he says, and says as he does.  I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so practices in line with the teaching, apart from the Buddha.  Also, the Buddha has gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision. He has achieved all he wished for regarding the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life.  I don’t see an",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 20  The Great Congregation  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants, all of whom were perfected ones.  And most of the deities from ten solar systems had gathered to see the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants.  Then four deities of the Pure Abodes, aware of what was happening, thought:  “Why don’t we go to the Buddha and each recite a verse in his presence?”  Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the Pure Abodes and reappeared in front of the Buddha.  They bowed to the Buddha and stood to one side.  Standing to one side, one deity spoke this verse in the Buddha’s presence:  “There’s a great congregation in the woods,  where heavenly hosts have assembled.  We’ve come to this righteous congregation  to see the invincible Saṅgha!”  Then another deity spoke this verse in the Buddha’s presence:  “The mendicants there are immersed in samādhi,  they’ve straightened their own minds.  Like a charioteer holding the reins,  the astute ones protect their senses.”  Then another deity spoke this verse in the Buddha’s presence:  “They snapped the post and snapped the cross-bar,  unstirred, they tore out Indra’s pillar.  They live pure and immaculate,  the young giants tamed by the Clear-eyed One.”  Then another deity spoke this verse in the Buddha’s presence:  “Anyone who has gone to the Buddha for refuge  won’t go to a plane of loss.  After giving up this human body,  they swell the hosts of gods.”  1. The Gathering of Deities  Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:  “Mendicants, most of the deities from ten solar systems have gathered to see the Realized One and the mendicant Saṅgha.  Those who were perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas in the past also had gatherings of deities that were at best like the gathering for me now.  Those who will be perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas in the future will also have gatherings of deities that will be at best like the gathering for me now.  I shall declare the names of the heavenly hosts;  I shall extol the names of the heavenly hosts;  I shall teach the names of the heavenly hosts.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “I invoke a paean of praise!  Where the earth-gods dwell,  there, in mountain caves,  resolute and composed,  dwell many like lonely lions,  who have mastered their fears.  Their minds are bright and pure,  clear and undisturbed.”  The teacher knew that over five hundred  were in the wood at Kapilavatthu.  Therefore he addressed  the disciples who love the teaching:  “The heavenly hosts have come forth;  mendicants, you should be aware of them.”  Those monks grew keen,  hearing the Buddha’s instruction.  Knowledge manifested in them,  seeing those non-human beings.  Some saw a hundred,  a thousand, even seventy thousand,  while some saw a hundred thousand  non-human beings.  But some saw an endless number  spread out in every direction.  And all that was known  and distinguished by the Clear-eyed One.  Therefore he addressed  the disciples who love the teaching:  “The heavenly hosts have come forth;  mendicants, you should be aware of them.  I shall extol them for you,  with lyrics in proper order.  There are seven thousand spirits,  earth-gods of Kapilavatthu.  They’re powerful and brilliant,  so beautiful and glorious.  Rejoicing, they’ve come forth  to the meeting of mendicants in the wood.  From the Himalayas there are six thousand  spirits of different colors.

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 21  Sakka’s Questions  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans, where east of Rājagaha there is a brahmin village named Ambasaṇḍā, north of which, on Mount Vediyaka, is Indra’s hill cave.  Now at that time Sakka, the lord of gods, grew eager to see the Buddha.  He thought,  “Where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”  Seeing that the Buddha was at Indra’s hill cave,  he addressed the gods of the thirty-three,  “Good fellows, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at Indra’s hill cave.  What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”  “Yes, lord,” replied the gods.  Then Sakka addressed the centaur Pañcasikha,  “Dear Pañcasikha, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at Indra’s hill cave.  What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”  “Yes, lord,” replied the centaur Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went as Sakka’s attendant.  Then Sakka went at the head of a retinue consisting of the gods of the thirty-three and the godling centaur Pañcasikha.  As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the heaven of the gods of the thirty-three and landed on Mount Vediyaka north of Ambasaṇḍā.  Now at that time a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā, as happens through the glory of the gods.  People in the villages round about, terrified, shocked, and awestruck, said,  “Mount Vediyaka must be on fire today, blazing and burning!  Oh why has such a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā?”  Then Sakka addressed the centaur Pañcasikha,  “My dear Pañcasikha, it is hard for one like me to get near the Realized Ones while they are on retreat practicing absorption, enjoying absorption.  But if you were to charm the Buddha first, then I could go to see him.”  “Yes, lord,” replied the centaur Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went to Indra’s hill cave. When he had drawn near, he stood to one side, thinking,  “This is neither too far nor too near; and he’ll hear my voice.”  1. Pañcasikha’s Song  Standing to one side, Pañcasikha played his arched harp, and sang these verses on the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the perfected ones, and sensual love.  “O Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, my Darling Sunshine,  I pay homage to your father Timbaru,  through whom was born a lady so fine,  to fill me with a joy I never knew.  As sweet as a breeze to one who’s sweating,  or when thirsty, a sweet and cooling drink,  so dear are you, Aṅgīrasi, to me— just like the teaching is to all the saints!  Like a cure when you’re struck by fever dire,  or food to ease the hunger pain,  come on, Bhaddā, please put out my fire,  quench me like water on a flame.  As elephants burning in the heat of summer,  sink down in a lotus pond to rest,  so cool, full of petals and of pollen— that’s how I would plunge into your breast.  Like elephants bursting bonds in rutting season,  beating off the pricks of lance and pikes— I just don’t understand what is the reason  I’m so crazy for your shapely thighs!  For you, my heart is full of passion,  I’m in a besotted state of mind.  There is no going back, I’m just not able,  I’m like a fish that’s hooked up on the line.  Come on, my Bhaddā, hold me, fair of thighs!  Embrace me, maid of captivating eyes!  Take me in your arms, my lovely lady,  that’s all I’d ever want or could desire.  Ah, then my desire was such a small thing,  my sweet, with your curling wavy hair;  now, like to arahants an offering,  it’s grown so very much from there.  Whatever the merit I have forged  by giving to such perfected beings— may that, my altogether gorgeous,  ripen in togetherness with you.  Whatever the merit I have forged  in this vast territory,  may that, my altogether gorgeous,  ripen in togetherness with you.  As the Sakyan, absorbed, did meditate  at one, alert, and mindful too,  the sage seeking the state free of death— so I, oh my Sunshine, seek for you!  And just like the sage would delight,  once he had awakened to the truth,  so I would delight, my fine lady,  were I to become one with you.  If Sakka were to grant me one wish,  as Lord of the Thirty and Three,  my Bhaddā, you’re all I would wish for,  so strong is the love in me.  Like a freshly blossoming sal tree  is your father, my lady so wise.  I pay homage to he, bowing humbly,  whose daughter is of such a kind.”  When Pañcasikha had spoken, the Buddha said to him,  “Pañcasikha, the sound of your strings blends well with the sound of your singing,  so that neither overpowers the other.  But when did you compose these verses on the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the perfected ones, and sensual love?”  “This one time, sir, when you were first awakened, you were staying in Uruvelā at the goatherd’s",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 22  The Longer Discourse on Mindfulness Meditation  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.  What four?  It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  1. Observing the Body  1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing  And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body?  It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence.  Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.  Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’  When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’  They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’  It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’  And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.  They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to fall, and as liable to both originate and vanish.  Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.  That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.  1.2. The Postures  Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’ When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’  Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.  And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.  They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to fall, and as liable to both originate and vanish.  Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.  That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.  1.3. Situational Awareness  Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl, and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.  And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …  That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.  1.4. Focusing on the Repulsive  Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.  ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’  It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And a person with clear eyes were to open it and examine the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’  And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …  That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.  1.5. Focusing on the Elements  Furthermore, a mendicant exa",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 23  With Pāyāsi  So I have heard.  At one time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Kosalan citadel named Setavyā.  He stayed in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā.  Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi was living in Setavyā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.  1. On Pāyāsi  Now at that time Pāyāsi had the following harmful misconception:  “There is no afterlife. No beings are reborn spontaneously. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.”  The brahmins and householders of Setavyā heard,  “It seems the ascetic Kassapa the Prince—a disciple of the ascetic Gotama—is staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā.  He has this good reputation:  ‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Then, exiting Setavyā, they formed into companies and headed north to the grove.  Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap.  He saw the brahmins and householders heading north towards the grove,  and addressed his butler,  “My butler, why are the brahmins and householders heading north towards the grove?”  “The ascetic Kassapa the Prince—a disciple of the ascetic Gotama—is staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā.  He has this good reputation:  ‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’  They’re going to see that Kassapa the Prince.”  “Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them:  ‘Sirs, the chieftain Pāyāsi asks  you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Kassapa the Prince.’  Before Kassapa the Prince persuades those foolish and incompetent brahmins and householders that  there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds— for none of these things are true!”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied the butler, and did as he was asked.  Then Pāyāsi escorted by the brahmins and householders, went up to Kassapa the Prince, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.  Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Setavyā bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward Kassapa the Prince, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.  2. Nihilism  Seated to one side, the chieftain Pāyāsi said to Venerable Kassapa the Prince,  “Worthy Kassapa, this is my doctrine and view:  ‘There is no afterlife. No beings are reborn spontaneously. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.’”  “Chieftain, may I never see or hear of anyone holding such a doctrine or view!  For how on earth can anyone say such a thing?  2.1. The Simile of the Moon and Sun  Well then, chieftain, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.  What do you think, chieftain?  Are the moon and sun in this world or the other world? Are they gods or humans?”  “They are in the other world, worthy Kassapa, and they are gods, not humans.”  “By this method it ought to be proven that  there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds.”  “Even though the worthy Kassapa says this, still I think that  there is no afterlife, no beings are reborn spontaneously, and there’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.”  “Is there a method by which you can prove what you say?”  “There is, worthy Kassapa.”  “How, exactly, chieftain?”  “Well, I have friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view.  Some time later they become sick, suffering, gravely ill.  When I know that  they will not recover from their illness, I go to them and say,  ‘Sirs, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:  “Those who kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct; use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and are covetous, malicious, and have wrong view—when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”  You do all these things.  If what those ascetics and brahmins say is true, when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.  If that happens, sirs, come and tell me that  there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds.  I trust you and b",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 24  About Pāṭikaputta  1. The Story of Sunakkhatta  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Anupiya.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Anupiya for alms.  Then it occurred to him,  “It’s too early to wander for alms in Anupiya.  Why don’t I go to visit the wanderer of the Bhaggava clan in his monastery?”  So that’s what he did.  Then the wanderer of the Bhaggava clan said to the Buddha,  “Let the Blessed One come, sir!  Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!  It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.  Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,  while the wanderer of the Bhaggava clan took a low seat, sat to one side,  and said to the Buddha,  “Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said:  ‘Now, Bhaggava, I have disavowed the Buddha.  Now I no longer live dedicated to him.’  Sir, is what Sunakkhatta said true?”  “Indeed it is, Bhaggava.  A few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said:  ‘Now I disavow the Buddha!  Now I shall no longer live dedicated to you.’  When Sunakkhatta said this, I said to him,  ‘But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you:  “Come, live dedicated to me”?’  ‘No, sir.’  ‘Or did you ever say to me:  “Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha”?’  ‘No, sir.’  ‘So it seems that I did not ask you to  live dedicated to me,  nor did you say you would  live dedicated to me.  In that case, you futile man, who are you and what do you want to disavow?  See how far you have strayed!’  ‘But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me.’  ‘But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you:  “Come, live dedicated to me and I will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for you”?’  ‘No, sir.’  ‘Or did you ever say to me:  “Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha, and the Buddha will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for me”?’  ‘No, sir.’  ‘So it seems that I did not ask this of you, and you did not require it of me.  In that case, you futile man, who are you and what do you want to disavow?  What do you think, Sunakkhatta?  Whether or not there is a demonstration of psychic power, does my teaching lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering?’  ‘It does, sir.’  ‘So it seems that whether or not there is a demonstration of psychic power, my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering.  In that case, what is the point of superhuman demonstrations of psychic power?  See how far you have strayed, you silly man!’  ‘But sir, the Buddha never describes the origin of the world to me.’  ‘But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you:  “Come, live dedicated to me and I will describe the origin of the world to you”?’  ‘No, sir.’  ‘Or did you ever say to me:  “Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha, and the Buddha will describe the origin of the world to me”?’  ‘No, sir.’  ‘So it seems that I did not ask this of you, and you did not require it of me.  In that case, you futile man, who are you and what do you want to disavow?  What do you think, Sunakkhatta?  Whether or not the origin of the world is described, does my teaching lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering?’  ‘It does, sir.’  ‘So it seems that whether or not the origin of the world is described, my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering.  In that case, what is the point of describing the origin of the world?  See how far you have strayed, you silly man!  In many ways, Sunakkhatta, you have praised me like this in the Vajjian capital:  “That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.”  In many ways you have praised the teaching like this in the Vajjian capital:  “The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.”  In many ways you have praised the Saṅgha like this in the Vajjian capital:  “The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individual persons. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”  I declare this to you, Sunakkhatta, I announce this to you!  There will be those who say that Sunakkhatta was unable to lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama. That’s why he resigned the training and returned to a l",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 25  The Lion’s Roar at the Monastery of Lady Udumbarikā  1. The Story of the Wanderer Nigrodha  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.  Now at that time the wanderer Nigrodha was residing in the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers, together with a large assembly of three thousand wanderers.  Then the householder Sandhāna left Rājagaha in the middle of the day to see the Buddha.  Then it occurred to him,  “It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha,  as he’s in retreat.  And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants,  as they’re in retreat.  Why don’t I visit the wanderer Nigrodha at the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers?”  So he went to the monastery of the wanderers.  Now at that time, Nigrodha was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a colossal racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as  talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.  Nigrodha saw Sandhāna coming off in the distance,  and hushed his own assembly:  “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.  The householder Sandhāna, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming.  He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Rājagaha.  Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.  Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”  Then those wanderers fell silent.  Then Sandhāna went up to the wanderer Nigrodha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Nigrodha,  “The way the wanderers make an uproar as they sit together and talk about all kinds of low topics is one thing.  It’s quite different to the way the Buddha frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.”  When Sandhāna said this, Nigrodha said to him,  “Surely, householder, you should know better! With whom does the ascetic Gotama converse? With whom does he engage in discussion? With whom does he achieve lucidity of wisdom?  Staying in empty huts has destroyed the ascetic Gotama’s wisdom. Not frequenting assemblies, he is unable to hold a discussion.  He just lurks on the periphery.  He’s just like a one-eyed cow, circling around and lurking on the periphery.  Go on, householder! Were the ascetic Gotama to come to this assembly, I’d sink him with just one question! I’d tie him up like a hollow pot!”  With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the householder Sandhāna and the wanderer Nigrodha.  Then the Buddha descended from Vulture’s Peak Mountain and went to the peacocks’ feeding ground on the bank of the Sumāgadhā, where he walked mindfully in the open air.  Nigrodha saw him,  and hushed his own assembly:  “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound. The ascetic Gotama is walking mindfully on the bank of the Sumāgadhā.  The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.  Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.  If he comes, I’ll ask him this question:  ‘Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?’”  Then those wanderers fell silent.  2. Mortification in Disgust of Sin  Then the Buddha went up to the wanderer Nigrodha,  who said to him,  “Let the Blessed One come, sir! Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!  It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.  Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,  while Nigrodha took a low seat and sat to one side.  The Buddha said to him,  “Nigrodha, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  Nigrodha said,  “Well, sir, I saw you walking mindfully and said:  ‘If the ascetic Gotama comes, I’ll ask him this question:  “Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?”’  This is the conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.”  “It’s hard for you to understand this, Nigrodha, since you have a different view, creed, and belief, unless you dedicate yourself to practice with the guidance of tradition.  Please ask me a question about the higher disgust of sin in your own tradition:  ‘How are the conditions for the fervent mortification in disgust of sin completed, and how are they incomplete?’",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 26  The Wheel-Turning Monarch  1. Taking Refuge in Oneself  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Mātulā.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.  And how does a mendicant do this?  They meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …  mind …  principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge, with no other refuge.  You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers.  If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers, Māra won’t find a vulnerability or get an opportunity.  It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that merit grows.  2. King Daḷhanemi  Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Daḷhanemi who was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures.  He had the following seven treasures:  the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.  He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.  After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword.  Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Daḷhanemi addressed one of his men,  ‘My good man, when you see that the heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place, please tell me.’  ‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man.  After many thousand years had passed, that man saw that the heavenly wheel-treasure had receded back from its place. So he went to King Daḷhanemi and said,  ‘Please sire, you should know that your heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place.’  So the king summoned the crown prince and said,  ‘Dear prince, my heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place.  I’ve heard that  when this happens to a wheel-turning monarch, he does not have long to live.  I have enjoyed human pleasures. Now it is time for me to seek heavenly pleasures.  Come, dear prince, rule this land surrounded by ocean!  I shall shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’  And so, after carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.  Seven days later the heavenly wheel-treasure vanished.  Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said,  ‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’  At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness.  He went to the royal seer and said,  ‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’  When he said this, the royal seer said to him,  ‘Don’t be unhappy at the vanishing of the wheel-treasure. My dear, the wheel-treasure is not inherited from your father.  Come now, my dear, proceed in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.  If you do so, it’s possible that—on a fifteenth day sabbath, having bathed your head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath—the heavenly wheel-treasure will appear to you, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.’  2.1. The Noble Duty of a Wheel-Turning Monarch  ‘But sire, what is the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch?’  ‘Well then, my dear, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as your flag, banner, and authority—provide just protection and security for your court, troops, aristocrats, vassals, brahmins and householders, people of town and country, ascetics and brahmins, beasts and birds.  Do not let injustice prevail in the realm.  Provide money to the penniless in the realm.  And there are ascetics and brahmins in the realm who refrain from intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves. From time to time you should go up to them and ask and learn:  “Sirs, what is skillful? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? Doing what leads to my lasting harm and suffering? Doing what leads to my lasting welfare and happiness?”  Having heard them, you should shun what is unskillful and undertake and follow what is skillful.  This is the noble duty o",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 27  What Came First  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.  Now at that time Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were living on probation among the mendicants in hopes of being ordained.  Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came downstairs from the longhouse and was walking mindfully in the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse.  Vāseṭṭha saw him  and said to Bhāradvāja,  “Reverend Bhāradvāja, the Buddha is walking mindfully in the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse.  Come, reverend, let’s go to the Buddha.  Hopefully we’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from him.”  “Yes, reverend,” replied Bhāradvāja.  So they went to the Buddha, bowed, and walked beside him.  Then the Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha,  “Vāseṭṭha, you are both brahmins by birth and family, and have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness from a brahmin family. I hope you don’t have to suffer abuse and insults from the brahmins.”  “Actually, sir, the brahmins do insult and abuse us with their typical insults to the fullest extent, holding nothing back.”  “But how do the brahmins insult you?”  “Sir, the brahmins say:  ‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.  Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.  Only brahmins are purified, not others.  Only brahmins are the Divinity’s true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity.  You’ve both abandoned the best class to join an inferior class, namely these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman.  This is not right, it’s not proper!’  That’s how the brahmins insult us.”  “Actually, Vāseṭṭha, the brahmins are forgetting their tradition when they say this to you.  For brahmin women are seen menstruating, being pregnant, giving birth, and breast-feeding.  Yet even though they’re born from a brahmin womb they say:  ‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.  Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.  Only brahmins are purified, not others.  Only brahmins are the Divinity’s true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity.’  They misrepresent the brahmins, speak falsely, and brim with much wickedness.  1. Purification in the Four Classes  Vāseṭṭha, there are these four classes:  aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.  Some aristocrats kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view.  These things are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are dark deeds with dark results, criticized by sensible people. Such things are exhibited in some aristocrats.  And they are also seen among some brahmins,  peasants,  and menials.  But some aristocrats refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they’re content, kind-hearted, with right view.  These things are skillful, blameless, to be cultivated, worthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are bright deeds with bright results, praised by sensible people. Such things are exhibited in some aristocrats.  And they are also seen among some brahmins,  peasants,  and menials.  Both these things occur like this, mixed up in these four classes—the dark and the bright, that which is praised and that which is criticized by sensible people. Yet of this the brahmins say:  ‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.  Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.  Only brahmins are purified, not others.  Only brahmins are the Divinity’s true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity.’  Sensible people don’t grant this.  Why is that?  Because any mendicant from these four classes who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their heart’s goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is said to be foremost by virtue of principle, not against principle.  For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the best thing for people in both this life and the next.  And here’s a way to understand how this is so.  King Pasenadi of Kosala knows that  the ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighboring clan of the Sakyans.  And the Sakyans are his vassals.  The Sakyans show deference to King Pasenadi by bowing down, rising up, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him.  Now, King Pasenadi shows the same kind of deference to the Realized One. But he doesn’t think: ‘The ascetic Gotama is well-bo",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 28  Inspiring Confidence  1. Sāriputta’s Lion’s Roar  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.  Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:  “Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.”  “That’s a grand and bold statement, Sāriputta. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying:  ‘I have such confidence in the Buddha that  I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’  What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you encompassed their minds to know that  those Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?”  “No, sir.”  “And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future? Have you encompassed their minds to know that  those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?”  “No, sir.”  “And what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present? Have you encompassed my mind to know that  I have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?”  “No, sir.”  “In that case, Sāriputta, given that you don’t encompass the minds of Buddhas past, future, or present,  what then are you doing, making such a grand and bold statement, roaring such a definitive, categorical lion’s roar?”  “Sir, though I don’t encompass the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present,  still I understand this by inference from the teaching.  Suppose there were a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate.  And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and clever. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in.  As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out.  They’d think,  ‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’  In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching:  ‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they awaken to the supreme perfect awakening.’  Sir, once I approached the Buddha to listen to the teaching.  He explained Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides.  When I directly knew a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how I was taught, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I had confidence in the Teacher:  ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’  1.1. Teaching Skillful Qualities  And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches skillful qualities is unsurpassable.  This consists of such skillful qualities as  the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.  By these a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.  This is unsurpassable when it comes to skillful qualities.  The Buddha understands this without exception. There is nothing to be understood beyond this whereby another ascetic or brahmin might be superior in direct knowledge to the Buddha when it comes to skillful qualities.  1.2. Describing the Sense Fields  And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the description of the sense fields is unsurpassable.  There are these six interior and exterior sense fields.  The eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, and the mind and ideas.  This is unsurpassable when it comes to describing the sense fields.  The Buddha understands this without exception. There is nothing to be understood beyond this whereby another ascetic or brahmin might be superior in direct knowledge to the Buddha when it comes to describing the sense fields.  1.3. The Conception of the Embryo  And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the conception of the embryo is unsurpassable.  There are these four kinds of conception.  Firstly, someone is unaware when conceived in their mother’s womb, unaware as they remain there, and unaware as they emerge. This is the first kind of conception.  Furthermore, someone i",

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans in a stilt longhouse in a mango grove belonging to those Sakyans named Vedhaññā.  Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had recently passed away at Pāvā.  With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, fighting, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words:  “You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”  You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics.  And the Jain Ñātika’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge.  And then, after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā, the novice Cunda went to see Venerable Ānanda at Sāma village. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.  Ānanda said to him,  “Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter.  Come, let’s go to the Buddha and tell him about this.”  “Yes, sir,” replied Cunda.  Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.  1. The Teaching of the Unawakened  “That’s what happens, Cunda, when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.  Take the case where a teacher is not awakened, and the teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.  A disciple in that teaching does not practice in line with the teaching, does not practice following that procedure, does not live in line with the teaching. They proceed having turned away from that teaching.  You should say this to them,  ‘You’re fortunate, reverend, you’re so very fortunate!  For your teacher is not awakened, and their teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.  But you don’t practice in line with that teaching, you don’t practice following that procedure, you don’t live in line with the teaching. You proceed having turned away from that teaching.’  In such a case the teacher and the teaching are to blame, but the disciple deserves praise.  Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple,  ‘Come on, venerable, practice as taught and pointed out by your teacher.’  The one who encourages, the one who they encourage, and the one who practices accordingly all brim with much wickedness.  Why is that?  It’s because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.  Take the case where a teacher is not awakened, and the teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.  A disciple in that teaching practices in line with the teaching, practices following that procedure, lives in line with the teaching. They proceed having undertaken that teaching.  You should say this to them,  ‘It’s your loss, reverend, it’s your misfortune! For your teacher is not awakened, and their teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.  And you practice in line with that teaching, you practice following that procedure, you live in line with the teaching. You proceed having undertaken that teaching.’  In such a case the teacher, the teaching, and the disciple are all to blame.  Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple,  ‘Clearly the venerable is practicing systematically and will succeed in that system.’  The one who praises, the one who they praise, and the one who, being praised, rouses up even more energy all brim with much wickedness.  Why is that?  It’s because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.  2. The Teaching of the Awakened  Take the case where a teacher is awakened, and the teaching is well explained and well propounded, eman",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 30  The Marks of a Great Man  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “There are thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.  If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.  He has the following seven treasures:  the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.  He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.  After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.  But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who has cast off the world’s veil.  And what are the thirty-two marks?  He has well-planted feet.  On the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail.  He has stretched heels.  He has long fingers.  His hands and feet are tender.  He has serried hands and feet.  The tops of his feet are arched.  His calves are like those of an antelope.  When standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees.  His private parts are covered in a foreskin.  He is golden colored; his skin shines like lustrous gold.  He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.  His hairs grow one per pore.  His hairs stand up; they’re blue-black and curl clockwise.  His body is tall and straight-limbed.  He has bulging muscles in seven places.  His chest is like that of a lion.  He is filled out between the shoulders.  He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his arms equals the height of his body.  His torso is cylindrical.  He has ridged taste buds.  His jaw is like that of a lion.  He has forty teeth.  His teeth are even.  His teeth have no gaps.  His teeth are perfectly white.  He has a large tongue.  He has the voice of the Divinity, <j>like a cuckoo’s call.  His eyes are indigo.  He has eyelashes like a cow’s.  Between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and white like cotton-wool.  The crown of his head is like a turban.  These are the thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.  Seers who are outsiders remember these marks, but they do not know  the specific deeds performed in the past to obtain each mark.  1. Well-Planted Feet  In some past lives, past existences, past abodes the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He firmly and persistently undertook skillful behaviors such as good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, giving and sharing, taking precepts, observing the sabbath, paying due respect to mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in the family, and various other things pertaining to skillful behaviors.  Due to performing, accumulating, heaping up, and amassing those deeds, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.  There he surpassed the other gods in ten respects: heavenly lifespan, beauty, happiness, glory, sovereignty, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.  When he passed away from there and came back to this place he obtained this mark of a great man:  he has well-planted feet.  He places his foot on the ground evenly, raises it evenly, and touches the ground evenly with the whole sole of his foot.  Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.  He has the following seven treasures:  the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.  He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.  After conquering this land girt by sea—free of harassment by bandits, successful and prosperous, safe, blessed, free of pests—he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.  And what does he obtain as king?  He can’t be stopped by any human foe or enemy.  That’s what he obtains as king.  But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who has cast off the world’s veil.  And what does he obtain as Buddha?  He can’t be stopped by any foe or enemy whether internal or external; nor by greed, hate, or delusion; nor by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.  That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”  The Buddha spoke this matter.  On this it is said:  “Truth, principle, self-control, and restraint;  purity, precepts, and observing the sabbath;  giving, harmlessness, delighting in non-violence— firmly under",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 31  Advice to Sigālaka  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Now at that time the householder’s son Sigālaka rose early and left Rājagaha. With his clothes and hair all wet, he raised his joined palms to revere the various quarters— east, south, west, north, below, and above.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.  He saw Sigālaka revering the various quarters  and said to him,  “Householder’s son, why are you revering the various quarters in this way?”  “Sir, on his deathbed my father said to me:  ‘My dear, please revere the quarters.’  Honoring, respecting, and venerating my father’s words, I rose early and left Rājagaha and, with my clothes and hair all wet, raised my joined palms to revere the various quarters— east, south, west, north, below, and above.”  1. The Six Directions  “Householder’s son, that’s not how the six directions should be revered in the training of the Noble One.”  “But sir, how should the six directions be revered in the training of the Noble One?  Sir, please teach me this.”  “Well then, householder’s son, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” replied Sigālaka.  The Buddha said this:  “Householder’s son, a noble disciple gives up four corrupt deeds, doesn’t do bad deeds on four grounds, and avoids six drains on wealth. When they’ve left these fourteen bad things behind they have the six directions covered.  They’re practicing to win in both worlds, and they succeed in this world and the next.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.  2. Four Corrupt Deeds  What four corrupt deeds have they given up?  Killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying: these are corrupt deeds.  These are the four corrupt deeds they’ve given up.”  That is what the Buddha said.  Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:  “Killing, stealing,  telling lies,  and committing adultery:  astute people don’t praise these things.”  3. Four Grounds  “On what four grounds do they not do bad deeds?  One does bad deeds prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice.  When a noble disciple is not prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice,  they don’t do bad deeds on these four grounds.”  That is what the Buddha said.  Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:  “If you act against the teaching  out of favoritism, hostility, cowardice, or stupidity,  your fame shrinks,  like the moon in the waning fortnight.  If you don’t act against the teaching  out of favoritism, hostility, cowardice, and stupidity,  your fame swells,  like the moon in the waxing fortnight.”  4. Six Drains on Wealth  “What six drains on wealth do they avoid?  Habitually engaging in the following things is a drain on wealth: consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants; roaming the streets at night; frequenting festivals; gambling; bad friends; laziness.  5. Six Drawbacks of Drinking  There are these six drawbacks of habitually consuming beer, wine, and liquor that cause intoxication.  Immediate loss of wealth, promotion of quarrels, susceptibility to illness, disrepute, indecent exposure; and weakened wisdom is the sixth thing.  These are the six drawbacks of habitually consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.  6. Six Drawbacks of Roaming the Streets at Night  There are these six drawbacks of roaming the streets at night.  Yourself, your partners and children, and your property are all left unguarded. You’re suspected of bad deeds. Untrue rumors spread about you. You’re at the forefront of many things that entail suffering.  These are the six drawbacks of roaming the streets at night.  7. Six Drawbacks of Festivals  There are these six drawbacks of frequenting festivals.  You’re always thinking: ‘Where’s the dancing? Where’s the singing? Where’s the music? Where are the stories? Where’s the applause? Where are the kettledrums?’  These are the six drawbacks of frequenting festivals.  8. Six Drawbacks of Gambling  There are these six drawbacks of habitually gambling.  Victory breeds enmity. The loser mourns their money. There is immediate loss of wealth. A gambler’s word carries no weight in public assembly. Friends and colleagues treat them with contempt. And no-one wants to marry a gambler, for they think:  ‘This individual is a gambler—they’re not able to support a partner.’  These are the six drawbacks of habitually gambling.  9. Six Drawbacks of Bad Friends  There are these six drawbacks of bad friends.  You become friends and companions with those who are addicts, carousers, drunkards, frauds, swindlers, and thugs.  These are the six drawbacks of bad friends.  10. Six Drawbacks of Laziness  There are these six drawbacks of habitual laziness.  You don’t get your work done because you think: ‘It’s too cold! It’s too hot. It’s too late! It’s too early!",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 32  The Āṭānāṭiya Protection  1. The First Recitation Section  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.  Then, late at night, the four great kings—with large armies of spirits, centaurs, gnomes, and dragons—set guards, troops, and wards at the four quarters and then, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak with their beauty, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.  Before sitting down to one side, some spirits bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.  Seated to one side, the Great King Vessavaṇa said to the Buddha,  “Sir, some high spirits have confidence in the Buddha,  some do not.  Some middling spirits have confidence in the Buddha,  some do not.  Some low spirits have confidence in the Buddha,  some do not.  But mostly the spirits don’t have confidence in the Buddha.  Why is that?  Because the Buddha teaches them to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, and consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.  But mostly they don’t refrain from such things.  They don’t like that or approve of it.  Sir, there are disciples of the Buddha who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.  There dwell high spirits who have no confidence in the Buddha’s dispensation.  To give them confidence, may the Buddha please learn the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.”  The Buddha consented with silence.  Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, on that occasion Great King Vessavaṇa recited the Āṭānāṭiya protection.  “Hail Vipassī,  the glorious Clear-eyed One!  Hail Sikhī,  sympathetic for all beings!  Hail Vessabhū,  cleansed and fervent!  Hail Kakusandha,  crusher of Māra’s army!  Hail Koṇāgamana,  the brahmin who has lived the life!  Hail Kassapa,  everywhere free!  Hail Aṅgīrasa,  the glorious Sakyan!  He taught this Dhamma  that casts aside all suffering.  Those in the world who are quenched,  truly discerning,  not backbiters; such people  being great of heart and intrepid,  revere that Gotama;  he who is helpful to gods and humans,  accomplished in knowledge and conduct,  great of heart and intrepid.  Where rises the sun— Aditi’s child, the great orb— with whose rising  night’s umbra also ends,  and of whom, when sun has risen,  it is said to be the day— there is a deep lake,  an ocean of flowing waters.  That’s how they understand that lake there,  as an ocean of flowing waters.  From here that is the eastern quarter,  so the people say.  That quarter is warded  by a great king, glorious,  the lord of the centaurs;  his name is Dhataraṭṭha.  He delights in song and dance,  honored by the centaurs.  And he has many mighty sons  all of one name, so I’ve heard.  Eighty, and ten, and one— all of them named Indra.  After seeing the Awakened One,  the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun,  they revere him from afar,  the one great of heart and intrepid.  Homage to you, O thoroughbred!  Homage to you, supreme among men!  You examine us skillfully;  the non-humans bow to you.  We’ve been asked many a time,  ‘Do you bow to Gotama the victor?’  And so we ought to declare:  ‘We bow to Gotama the victor,  accomplished in knowledge and conduct!  We bow to Gotama the awakened!’  It’s where the departed go, they say,  who are dividers and backbiters,  killers and hunters,  bandits and cheats.  From here that is the southern quarter,  so the people say.  That quarter is warded  by a great king, glorious,  the lord of the gnomes;  his name is Virūḷha.  He delights in song and dance,  honored by the gnomes.  And he has many mighty sons  all of one name, so I’ve heard.  Eighty, and ten, and one— all of them named Indra.  After seeing the Awakened One,  the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun,  they revere him from afar,  the one great of heart and intrepid.  Homage to you, O thoroughbred!  Homage to you, supreme among men!

We’ve been asked many a time,  ‘Do you bow to Gotama the victor?’  And so we ought to declare:  ‘We bow to Gotama the victor,  accomplished in knowledge and conduct!  We bow to Gotama the awakened!’  Where sets the sun— Aditi’s child, the great orb— with whose setting  the day also ends;  and of whom, when sun has set,  it is said to be night’s umbra— there is a deep lake in that place,  an ocean of flowing waters.  That’s how they understand that lake there,  as an ocean of flowing waters.  From here that is the western quarter,  so the people say.  That quarter is warded  by a great king, glorious,  the lord of the dragons;  his name is Virūpakkha.  He delights in song and dance,  honored by the dragons.  And he has many mighty son",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 33  Reciting in Concert  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Mallian town named Pāvā.  There he stayed in Cunda the smith’s mango grove.  Now at that time a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka had recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any human at all.  The Mallas of Pāvā also heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in Cunda’s mango grove.  Then they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka has recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any human at all.  May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Mallas of Pāvā use it.  That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Mallas of Pāvā.”  The Buddha consented in silence.  Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Mallas got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha,  bowed, stood to one side,  and told him of their preparations, saying,  “Please, sir, come at your convenience.”  Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east.  The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.  The Mallas of Pāvā also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.  The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Mallas with a Dhamma talk. Then he sent them off,  “The night is getting late, Vāseṭṭhas.  Please go at your convenience.”  “Yes, sir,” replied the Mallas. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.  Soon after they left, the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed Venerable Sāriputta,  “Sāriputta, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness.  Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired.  My back is sore,  I’ll stretch it.”  “Yes, sir,” Sāriputta replied.  And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.  Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had recently passed away at Pāvā.  With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, fighting, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words:  “You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”  You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics.  And the Jain Ñātika’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge.  Then Sāriputta told the mendicants about these things. He went on to say,  “That’s what happens, reverends, when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.  But this teaching is well explained and well propounded to us by the Blessed One, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha.  You should all recite this in concert, without disputing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.  And what is that teaching?  1. Ones  There are teachings grouped by one that have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  You should all recite these in concert, without disputing, so that this spirit",

    "text_english": "Long Discourses 34  Up to Ten  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.  There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:  “Reverends, mendicants!”  “Reverend,” they replied.  Sāriputta said this:  “I will relate the teachings  up to ten for attaining extinguishment,  for making an end of suffering,  the release from all ties.  1. Groups of One  Reverends, one thing is helpful, one thing should be developed, one thing should be completely understood, one thing should be given up, one thing makes things worse, one thing leads to distinction, one thing is hard to comprehend, one thing should be produced, one thing should be directly known, one thing should be realized.  <em>What one thing is helpful?</em>  Diligence in skillful qualities.  <em>What one thing should be developed?</em>  Mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure.  <em>What one thing should be completely understood?</em>  Contact, which is accompanied by defilements and fuels grasping.  <em>What one thing should be given up?</em>  The conceit ‘I am’.  <em>What one thing makes things worse?</em>  Irrational application of mind.  <em>What one thing leads to distinction?</em>  Rational application of mind.  <em>What one thing is hard to comprehend?</em>  The heart’s immersion of immediate result.  <em>What one thing should be produced?</em>  Unshakable knowledge.  <em>What one thing should be directly known?</em>  All sentient beings are sustained by food.  <em>What one thing should be realized?</em>  The unshakable release of the heart.  So these ten things that are true, real, and accurate, not unreal, not otherwise were rightly understood by the Realized One.  2. Groups of Two  Two things are helpful, two things should be developed, two things should be completely understood, two things should be given up, two things make things worse, two things lead to distinction, two things are hard to comprehend, two things should be produced, two things should be directly known, two things should be realized.  <em>What two things are helpful?</em>  Mindfulness and situational awareness.  <em>What two things should be developed?</em>  Serenity and discernment.  <em>What two things should be completely understood?</em>  Name and form.  <em>What two things should be given up?</em>  Ignorance and craving for continued existence.  <em>What two things make things worse?</em>  Being hard to admonish and having bad friends.  <em>What two things lead to distinction?</em>  Being easy to admonish and having good friends.  <em>What two things are hard to comprehend?</em>  The causes and reasons for the corruption of sentient beings, and the causes and reasons for the purification of sentient beings.  <em>What two things should be produced?</em>  Two knowledges:  knowledge of ending, and knowledge of non-arising.  <em>What two things should be directly known?</em>  Two elements:  the conditioned element and the unconditioned element.  <em>What two things should be realized?</em>  Knowledge and freedom.  So these twenty things that are true, real, and accurate, not unreal, not otherwise were rightly understood by the Realized One.  3. Groups of Three  Three things are helpful, etc.  <em>What three things are helpful?</em>  Associating with true persons, listening to the true teaching, and practicing in line with the teaching.  <em>What three things should be developed?</em>  Three kinds of immersion.  Immersion with placing the mind and keeping it connected. Immersion without placing the mind, merely keeping it connected. Immersion without placing the mind or keeping it connected.  <em>What three things should be completely understood?</em>  Three feelings:  pleasant, painful, and neutral.  <em>What three things should be given up?</em>  Three cravings:  craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for nonexistence.  <em>What three things make things worse?</em>  Three unskillful roots:  greed, hate, and delusion.  <em>What three things lead to distinction?</em>  Three skillful roots:  contentment, love, and understanding.  <em>What three things are hard to comprehend?</em>  Three elements of escape.  Renunciation is the escape from sensual pleasures. The formless is the escape from form. Cessation is the escape from whatever is created, conditioned, and dependently originated.  <em>What three things should be produced?</em>  Three knowledges:  knowledge regarding the past portion, the future portion, and the present portion.  <em>What three things should be directly known?</em>  Three elements:  sensuality, form, and formlessness.  <em>What three things should be realized?</em>  Three knowledges:  recollection of past lives, knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings, and knowledge of the ending of defilements.  So these thirty things that are true, real, and accurate, not unreal, not otherwise were rightly understood by ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 1  The Root of All Things  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the root of all things.  Listen and apply your minds well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They perceive earth as earth.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 2  All the Defilements  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the restraint of all defilements.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see.  For one who knows and sees what?  Rational application of mind and irrational application of mind.  When you apply the mind irrationally, defilements arise, and once arisen they grow.  When you apply the mind rationally, defilements don’t arise, and those that have already arisen are given up.  Some defilements should be given up by seeing, some by restraint, some by using, some by enduring, some by avoiding, some by dispelling, and some by developing.  1. Defilements Given Up by Seeing  And what are the defilements that should be given up by seeing?  Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They don’t understand to which things they should apply the mind and to which things they should not apply the mind.  So they apply the mind to things they shouldn’t and don’t apply the mind to things they should.  And what are the things to which they apply the mind but should not?  They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow: the defilements of sensual desire,  desire to be reborn,  and ignorance.  These are the things to which they apply the mind but should not.  And what are the things to which they do not apply the mind but should?  They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements: the defilements of sensual desire,  desire to be reborn,  and ignorance.  These are the things to which they do not apply the mind but should.  Because of applying the mind to what they should not and not applying the mind to what they should, unarisen defilements arise and arisen defilements grow.  This is how they apply the mind irrationally:  ‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past?  Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’  Or they are undecided about the present thus:  ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?’  When they apply the mind irrationally in this way, one of the following six views arises in them and is taken as a genuine fact.  The view: ‘My self survives.’  The view: ‘My self does not survive.’  The view: ‘I perceive the self with the self.’  The view: ‘I perceive what is not-self with the self.’  The view: ‘I perceive the self with what is not-self.’  Or they have such a view:  ‘This self of mine is he, the one who speaks, the one who knows, who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms. This self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’  This is called a misconception, the thicket of views, the desert of views, the twist of views, the dodge of views, the fetter of views.  An unlearned ordinary person who is fettered by views is not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.  They’re not freed from suffering, I say.  But take a learned noble disciple who has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They understand to which things they should apply the mind and to which things they should not apply the mind.  So they apply the mind to things they should and don’t apply the mind to things they shouldn’t.  And what are the things to which they don’t apply the mind and should not?  They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow: the defilements of sensual desire,  desire to be reborn,  and ignorance.  These are the things to which they don’t apply the mind and should not.  And what are the things to which they do apply the mind and should?  They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements: the defilements of sensual desire,  desire to be reborn,  and ignorance.  These are the things to ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 3  Heirs in the Teaching  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.  Out of sympathy for you, I think,  ‘How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh?’  If you become heirs in things of the flesh, not in the teaching, that will make you liable to the accusation:  ‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in things of the flesh, not in the teaching.’  And it will make me liable to the accusation:  ‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in things of the flesh, not in the teaching.’  If you become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh, that will make you not liable to the accusation:  ‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.’  And it will make me not liable to the accusation:  ‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.’  So, mendicants, be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.  Out of sympathy for you, I think,  ‘How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh?’  Suppose that I had eaten and refused more food, being full, and having had as much as I needed.  And there was some extra almsfood that was going to be thrown away.  Then two mendicants were to come who were weak with hunger.  I’d say to them,  ‘Mendicants, I have eaten and refused more food, being full, and having had as much as I need.  And there is this extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away.  Eat it if you like. Otherwise I’ll throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.’  Then one of those mendicants thought,  ‘The Buddha has eaten and refused more food.  And he has some extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away.  If we don’t eat it he’ll throw it away.  But the Buddha has also said:  “Be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.”  And almsfood is one of the things of the flesh.  Instead of eating this almsfood, why don’t I spend this day and night weak with hunger?’  And that’s what they did.  Then the second of those mendicants thought,  ‘The Buddha has eaten and refused more food.  And he has some extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away.  If we don’t eat it he’ll throw it away.  Why don’t I eat this almsfood, then spend the day and night having got rid of my hunger and weakness?’  And that’s what they did.  Even though that mendicant, after eating the almsfood, spent the day and night rid of hunger and weakness, it is the former mendicant who is more worthy of respect and praise.  Why is that?  Because for a long time that will conduce to that mendicant being of few wishes, content, self-effacing, unburdensome, and energetic.  So, mendicants, be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.  Out of sympathy for you, I think,  ‘How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh?’”  That is what the Buddha said.  When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.  Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants,  “Reverends, mendicants!”  “Reverend,” they replied.  Sāriputta said this:  “Reverends, how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusion? And how do they train in seclusion?”  “Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.  May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.  The mendicants will listen and remember it.”  “Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, reverend,” they replied.  Sāriputta said this:  “Reverends, how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusion?  The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion.  They don’t give up what the Teacher tells them to give up.  They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion.  In this case, the senior mendicants should be criticized on three grounds.  ‘The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion.’  This is the first ground.  ‘They don’t give up what the Teacher tells them to give up.’  This is the second ground.  ‘They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion.’  This is the third ground.  The senior mendicants should be criticized on these three grounds.  In this case, the middle mendicants  and the junior mendicants should be criticized on the same three grounds.  This is how the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion.  And how do the disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusion?  The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion trai",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 4  Fear and Dread  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:  “Mister Gotama, those gentlemen who, out of faith in you, have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have you to lead the way, help them out, and give them encouragement.  And those people follow the worthy Gotama’s example.”  “That’s so true, brahmin! Everything you say is true, brahmin!”  “But worthy Gotama, remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in solitude.  The forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi.”  “That’s so true, brahmin! Everything you say is true, brahmin!  Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought,  ‘Remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in solitude.  The forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi.’  Then I thought,  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified conduct of body, speech, and mind who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their conduct.  But I don’t frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified conduct of body, speech, and mind.  My conduct is purified.  I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified conduct of body, speech, and mind.’  Seeing this purity of conduct in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest.  Then I thought,  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified livelihood who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their livelihood.  But I don’t frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified livelihood.  My livelihood is purified.  I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified livelihood.’  Seeing this purity of livelihood in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest.  Then I thought,  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins full of desire for sensual pleasures, with acute lust …  I am not full of desire …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins full of ill will, with malicious intentions …  I have a heart full of love …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins overcome with dullness and drowsiness …  I am free of dullness and drowsiness …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are restless, with no peace of mind …  My mind is peaceful …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are doubting and uncertain …  I’ve gone beyond doubt …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who glorify themselves and put others down …  I don’t glorify myself and put others down …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are cowardly and craven …  I don’t get startled …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy possessions, honor, and popularity …  I have few wishes …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are lazy and lack energy …  I am energetic …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are unmindful and lack situational awareness …  I am mindful …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who lack immersion, with straying minds …  I am accomplished in immersion …’  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are witless and idiotic who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of the defects of witlessness and stupidity.  But I don’t frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest witless and idiotic.  I am accomplished in wisdom.  I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest accomplished in wisdom.’  Seeing this accomplishment of wisdom in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest.  Then I thought,  ‘There are certain nights that are recognized as specially portentous:  the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.  On such nights, why don’t I stay in awe-inspiring and hair-raising shrines in parks, forests, and trees? In such lodgings, hopefully I might see that fear and dread.’  Some time later, that’s what I did.  As I was staying there a deer came by, or a peacock snapped a twig, or the wind rustled the leaves.  Then I thought,  ‘Is this that fear and dread coming?’  Then I thought,  ‘Why do I always meditate expecting that fear to come?  Why don’t I get rid of that fear and dread just as it comes, while remaining just as I am?’  Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was walking.  I didn’t stand still or sit dow",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 5  Unblemished  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:  “Reverends, mendicants!”  “Reverend,” they replied.  Sāriputta said this:  “Reverends, these four individuals are found in the world.  What four?  One individual with a blemish doesn’t truly understand: ‘There is a blemish in me.’  But another individual with a blemish does truly understand: ‘There is a blemish in me.’  One individual without a blemish doesn’t truly understand: ‘There is no blemish in me.’  But another individual without a blemish does truly understand: ‘There is no blemish in me.’  In this case, of the two individuals with a blemish, the one who doesn’t understand is said to be worse,  while the one who does understand is better.  And of the two individuals without a blemish, the one who doesn’t understand is said to be worse,  while the one who does understand is better.”  When he said this, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him:  “What is the cause, Reverend Sāriputta, what is the reason why, of the two individuals with a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better?  And what is the cause, what is the reason why, of the two individuals without a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better?”  “Reverends, take the case of the individual who has a blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that they won’t generate enthusiasm, make an effort, or rouse up energy to give up that blemish.  And they will die with greed, hate, and delusion, blemished, with a corrupted mind.  Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy covered with dirt or stains.  And the owners neither used it or had it cleaned, but kept it in a dirty place.  Over time, wouldn’t that bronze cup get even dirtier and more stained?”  “Yes, reverend.”  “In the same way, take the case of the individual who has a blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that …  they will die with a corrupted mind.  Take the case of the individual who has a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that they will generate enthusiasm, make an effort, and rouse up energy to give up that blemish.  And they will die without greed, hate, and delusion, unblemished, with an uncorrupted mind.  Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy covered with dirt or stains.  But the owners used it and had it cleaned, and didn’t keep it in a dirty place.  Over time, wouldn’t that bronze cup get cleaner and brighter?”  “Yes, reverend.”  “In the same way, take the case of the individual who has a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that …  they will die with an uncorrupted mind.  Take the case of the individual who doesn’t have a blemish but does not understand it. You can expect that they will focus on the feature of beauty, and because of that, lust will infect their mind.  And they will die with greed, hate, and delusion, blemished, with a corrupted mind.  Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright.  And the owners neither used it or had it cleaned, but kept it in a dirty place.  Over time, wouldn’t that bronze cup get dirtier and more stained?”  “Yes, reverend.”  “In the same way, take the case of the individual who has no blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that …  they will die with a corrupted mind.  Take the case of the individual who doesn’t have a blemish and does understand it.

And this is the cause, this is the reason why, of the two individuals without a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better.”  “Reverend, the word ‘blemish’ is spoken of.  But what is ‘blemish’ a term for?”  “Reverend, ‘blemish’ is a term for the spheres of bad, unskillful wishes.  It’s possible that some mendicant might wish:  ‘If I commit an offense, I hope the mendicants don’t find out!’  But it’s possible that the mendicants do find out that that mendicant  has committed an offense.  Thinking, ‘The mendicants have found out about my offense,’  they get angry and bitter.  And that anger and that bitterness  are both blemishes.  It’s possible that some mendicant might wish:  ‘If I commit an offense, I hope the mendicants accuse me in private, not in the middle of the Saṅgh",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 6  One Might Wish  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, live by the ethical precepts and the monastic code. Live restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I be liked and approved by my spiritual companions, respected and admired.’ So let them fulfill their precepts, be committed to inner serenity of the heart, not neglect absorption, be endowed with discernment, and frequent empty huts.  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.’ So let them fulfill their precepts, be committed to inner serenity of the heart, not neglect absorption, be endowed with discernment, and frequent empty huts.  A mendicant might wish: ‘May the services of those whose robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick I enjoy be very fruitful and beneficial for them.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘When deceased family and relatives who have passed away recollect me with a confident mind, may this be very fruitful and beneficial for them.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I prevail over desire and discontent, and may desire and discontent not prevail over me. May I live having mastered desire and discontent whenever they arose.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I prevail over fear and dread, and may fear and dread not prevail over me. May I live having mastered fear and dread whenever they arose.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when I want, without trouble or difficulty.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I, with the ending of three fetters, become a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, destined for awakening.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, become a once-returner, coming back to this world once only, then making an end of suffering.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I, with the ending of the five lower fetters, be reborn spontaneously and become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again; materializing and dematerializing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with my hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having encompassed them with my mind.  May I understand mind with greed as “mind with greed”,  and mind without greed as “mind without greed”;  mind with hate as “mind with hate”,  and mind without hate as “mind without hate”;  mind with delusion as “mind with delusion”,  and mind without delusion as “mind without delusion”;  constricted mind as “constricted mind”,  and scattered mind as “scattered mind”;  expansive mind as “expansive mind”,  and unexpansive mind as “unexpansive mind”;  mind that is not supreme as “mind that is not supreme”,  and mind that is supreme as “mind that is supreme”;  mind immersed in samādhi as “mind immersed in samādhi”,  and mind not immersed in samādhi as “mind not immersed in samādhi”;  freed mind as “freed mind”,  and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind”.’  So let them fulfill their precepts …  A mendicant might wish: ‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Suppose, mendicants, there was a cloth that was dirty and soiled.  No matter what dye the dyer applied—whether blue or yellow or red or magenta—it would look poorly dyed and impure in color.  Why is that?  Because of the impurity of the cloth.  In the same way, when the mind is corrupt, a bad destiny is to be expected.  Suppose there was a cloth that was pure and clean.  No matter what dye the dyer applied—whether blue or yellow or red or magenta—it would look well dyed and pure in color.  Why is that?  Because of the purity of the cloth.  In the same way, when the mind isn’t corrupt, a good destiny is to be expected.  And what are the corruptions of the mind?  Covetousness and immoral greed, ill will, anger, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deceit, deviousness, obstinacy, aggression, conceit, arrogance, vanity, and negligence are corruptions of the mind.  A mendicant who understands that covetousness and immoral greed are corruptions of the mind gives them up.  A mendicant who understands that ill will …  negligence is a corruption of the mind gives it up.  When they have understood these corruptions of the mind  for what they are, and have given them up,  they have experiential confidence in the Buddha:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  They have experiential confidence in the teaching:  ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’  They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:  ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individual persons. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’  When a mendicant has discarded, eliminated, released, given up, and relinquished to this extent, thinking, ‘I have experiential confidence in the Buddha …  the teaching …  the Saṅgha,’ they find inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and find joy connected with the teaching.  Thinking: ‘I have discarded, eliminated, released, given up, and relinquished to this extent,’ they find inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and find joy connected with the teaching.  When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.  When a mendicant of such ethics, such qualities, and such wisdom eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces, that is no obstacle for them.  Compare with cloth that is dirty and soiled; it can be made pure and clean by pure water. Or native gold, which can be made pure and bright by a forge.  In the same way, when a mendicant of such ethics, such qualities, and such wisdom eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces, that is no obstacle for them.  They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.  They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 8  Self-Effacement  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahācunda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:  “Sir, there are many different views that arise in the world  connected with theories of self or with theories of the cosmos.  How does a mendicant who is focusing on the starting point give up and let go of these views?”  “Cunda, there are many different views that arise in the world  connected with theories of self or with theories of the cosmos.  A mendicant gives up and lets go of these views by truly seeing with right wisdom where they arise, where they settle in, and where they operate as: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’  It’s possible that a certain mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, might enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.  They might think  they’re practicing self-effacement.  But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;  they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’.  It’s possible that some mendicant, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, might enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.  They might think  they’re practicing self-effacement.  But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;  they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’.  It’s possible that some mendicant, with the fading away of rapture, might enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’  They might think  they’re practicing self-effacement.  But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;  they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’.  It’s possible that some mendicant, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, might enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.  They might think  they’re practicing self-effacement.  But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;  they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’.  It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.  They might think  they’re practicing self-effacement.  But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;  they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’.  It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.  They might think  they’re practicing self-effacement.  But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;  they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’.  It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, might enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.  They might think  they’re practicing self-effacement.  But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;  they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’.  It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, might enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.  They might think  they’re practicing self-effacement.  But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;  they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’.  1. The Exposition of Self-Effacement  Now in this regard, Cunda, you should work on self-effacement in each of the following ways.  ‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’  ‘Others will kill living creatures, but here we will not kill living creatures.’  ‘Others will steal, but here we will not steal.’  ‘Others will be unchaste, but here we will not be unchaste.’  ‘Others will lie, but here we will not lie.’  ‘Others will speak divisively, but here we will not speak divisively.’  ‘Others will speak harshly, but here we will not speak harshly.’  ‘Others will talk nonsense, but here we will not talk nonsense.’  ‘Others will be covetous, but here we will not be covetous.’  ‘Others will have ill will, but here we will not have ill will.’  ‘Others will have wrong view, but here we",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 9  Right View  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:  “Reverends, mendicants!”  “Reverend,” they replied.  Sāriputta said this:  “Reverends, they speak of this thing called ‘right view’.  How do you define a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching?”  “Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.  May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.  The mendicants will listen and remember it.”  “Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, reverend,” they replied.  Sāriputta said this:  “A noble disciple understands the unskillful and its root, and the skillful and its root.  When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.  But what is the unskillful and what is its root? And what is the skillful and what is its root?  Killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and covetousness, ill will, and wrong view.  This is called the unskillful.  And what is the root of the unskillful?  Greed, hate, and delusion.  This is called the root of the unskillful.  And what is the skillful?  Avoiding killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; avoiding speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, good will, and right view.  This is called the skillful.  And what is the root of the skillful?  Contentment, love, and understanding.  This is called the root of the skillful.  A noble disciple understands in this way the unskillful and its root, and the skillful and its root. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life.  When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.”  Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said. Then they asked another question:  “But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching?”  “There might, reverends.  A noble disciple understands fuel, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.  When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.  But what is fuel? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation?  These four fuels maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those about to be born.  What four?  Edible food, whether solid or subtle; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.  Fuel originates from craving. Fuel ceases when craving ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of fuel is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:  right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.  A noble disciple understands in this way fuel, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life.  When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.”  Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants … asked another question:  “But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who … has come to the true teaching?”  “There might, reverends.  A noble disciple understands suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.  When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who … has come to the true teaching.  But what is suffering? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation?  Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; being coupled with the disliked is suffering; separat",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 10  Mindfulness Meditation  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.  What four?  It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  1. Observing the Body  1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing  And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body?  It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence.  Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.  Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’  When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’  They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’  It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’  And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.  They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to fall, and as liable to both originate and vanish.  Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.  That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.  1.2. The Postures  Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’ When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’  Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.  And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.  They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to fall, and as liable to both originate and vanish.  Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.  That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.  1.3. Situational Awareness  Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.  And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …  That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.  1.4. Focusing on the Repulsive  Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.  ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’  It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And a person with clear eyes were to open it and examine the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’  And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …  That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.  1.5. Focusing on the Elements  Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, w",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 11  The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “‘Only here is there a true ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, and here a fourth ascetic.  Other sects are empty of ascetics.’  This, mendicants, is how you should rightly roar your lion’s roar.  It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say:  ‘But what is the source of the venerables’ certainty and forcefulness that they say this?’  You should say to them:  ‘There are four things explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Seeing these things in ourselves we say that:  “Only here is there a true ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, and here a fourth ascetic.  Other sects are empty of ascetics.”  What four?  We have confidence in the Teacher, we have confidence in the teaching, and we have fulfilled the precepts.  And we have love and affection for those who share our path,  both laypeople and renunciates.  These are the four things.’  It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say:  ‘We too have confidence in the Teacher—our Teacher; we have confidence in the teaching—our teaching; and we have fulfilled the precepts—our precepts.  And we have love and affection for those who share our path,  both laypeople and renunciates.  What, then, is the difference between you and us?’  You should say to them:  ‘Well, reverends, is the goal one or many?’  Answering rightly, the wanderers would say:  ‘The goal is one, reverends, not many.’  ‘But is that goal for the greedy or for those free of greed?’  Answering rightly, the wanderers would say:  ‘That goal is for those free of greed, not for the greedy.’  ‘Is it for the hateful or those free of hate?’  ‘It’s for those free of hate.’  ‘Is it for the delusional or those free of delusion?’  ‘It’s for those free of delusion.’  ‘Is it for those who crave or those rid of craving?’  ‘It’s for those rid of craving.’  ‘Is it for those who have fuel for grasping or those who do not?’  ‘It’s for those who do not have fuel for grasping.’  ‘Is it for the knowledgeable or the ignorant?’  ‘It’s for the knowledgeable.’  ‘Is it for those who favor and oppose or for those who don’t favor and oppose?’  ‘It’s for those who don’t favor and oppose.’  ‘But is that goal for those who enjoy proliferation or for those who enjoy non-proliferation?’  Answering rightly, the wanderers would say:  ‘It’s for those who enjoy non-proliferation, not for those who enjoy proliferation.’  Mendicants, there are these two views:  views favoring existence and views favoring nonexistence.  Any ascetics or brahmins who resort to, draw near to, and cling to a view favoring existence will oppose a view favoring nonexistence.  Any ascetics or brahmins who resort to, draw near to, and cling to a view favoring nonexistence will oppose a view favoring existence.  There are some ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand these two views’ origin, disappearance, gratification, drawback, and escape. They’re greedy, hateful, delusional, craving, grasping, and ignorant. They favor and oppose, and they enjoy proliferation.  They’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.  They’re not freed from suffering, I say.  There are some ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand these two views’ origin, disappearance, gratification, drawback, and escape. They’re rid of greed, hate, delusion, craving, grasping, and ignorance. They don’t favor and oppose, and they enjoy non-proliferation.  They’re freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.  They’re freed from suffering, I say.  There are these four kinds of grasping.  What four?  Grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self.  There are some ascetics and brahmins who claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping.  But they don’t correctly describe the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping.  They describe the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures, but not views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self.  Why is that?  Because those gentlemen don’t truly understand these three things.  That’s why they claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping,  but they don’t really.  There are some other ascetics and brahmins who claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping,  but they don’t really.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 12  The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying outside the city of Vesālī in a woodland grove west of the town.  Now at that time Sunakkhatta the Licchavi had recently left this teaching and training.  He was telling a crowd in Vesālī:  “The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.  He teaches what he’s worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.  And his teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it’s taught.”  Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.  He heard what Sunakkhatta was saying.  Then he wandered for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.  “Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta, that futile man, is angry.  His words are spoken out of anger.  Thinking he criticizes the Realized One, in fact he just praises him.  For it is praise of the Realized One to say:  ‘His teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it’s taught.’  But there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:  ‘That Blessed One wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying himself and becoming one again; materializing and dematerializing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.’  And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:  ‘That Blessed One, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hears both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.’  And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:  ‘That Blessed One understands the minds of other beings and individuals, having encompassed them with his own mind.  He understands mind with greed as “mind with greed,”  and mind without greed as “mind without greed.”  He understands mind with hate …  mind without hate …  mind with delusion …  mind without delusion …  constricted mind …  scattered mind …  expansive mind …  unexpansive mind …  mind that is supreme …  mind that is not supreme …  mind immersed in samādhi …  mind not immersed in samādhi …  freed mind as “freed mind,”  and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind.”’  There are these ten powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.  What ten?  Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible, and the impossible as impossible.  Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.  Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and causes.  Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …  Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands where all paths of practice lead.  Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …  Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the world with its many and diverse elements.  Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …  Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the diverse convictions of sentient beings.  Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …  Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the faculties of other sentient beings and other individuals after encompassing them with his mind.  Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …  Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments.  Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …  Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this,",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 13  The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.  Then it occurred to them,  “It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī.  Why don’t we visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?”  Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them:  “Reverends, the ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, and so do we.  The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of forms, and so do we.  The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of feelings, and so do we.  What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?”  Those mendicants neither approved nor rejected that statement of the wanderers of other religions.  They got up from their seat, thinking,  “We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”  Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said:  “Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say to them:  ‘But reverends, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to sensual pleasures?  What’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to forms?  What’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to feelings?’  Questioned like this, the wanderers of other religions would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated.  Why is that?  Because they’re out of their element.  I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.  And what is the gratification of sensual pleasures?  There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.  What five?  Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  Sounds known by the ear …  Smells known by the nose …  Tastes known by the tongue …  Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.  The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation: this is the gratification of sensual pleasures.  And what is the drawback of sensual pleasures?  It’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as  arithmetic, accounting, calculating, farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions.  But they must face cold and heat, being hurt by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles, and risking death from hunger and thirst.  This is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.  That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, but fail to accrue  money.  If this happens, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion, saying:  ‘Oh, my hard work is wasted. My efforts are fruitless!’  This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.  That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, and succeed in earning money.  But they experience pain and sadness when they try to protect it, thinking:  ‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’  And even though they protect it and ward it, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it.  They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion:  ‘What once was mine is gone.’  This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.  Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend.  Once they’ve started quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attack each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords,  resulting in death and deadly pain.  This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 14  The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.  Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “For a long time, sir, I have understood your teaching like this:  ‘Greed, hate, and delusion are corruptions of the mind.’  Despite understanding this, sometimes my mind is occupied by thoughts of greed, hate, and delusion.  I wonder what qualities remain in me that I have such thoughts?”  “Mahānāma, there is a quality that remains in you that makes you have such thoughts.  For if you had given up that quality you would not still be living at home and enjoying sensual pleasures.  But because you haven’t given up that quality you are still living at home and enjoying sensual pleasures.  Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.  So, Mahānāma, even though a noble disciple has clearly seen this with right wisdom, as long as they do not achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that,  they can return to sensual pleasures.  But when they do achieve that rapture and bliss, or something more peaceful than that,  they do not return to sensual pleasures.  Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too clearly saw with right wisdom that:  ‘Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.’  But so long as I didn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that,  I didn’t announce that I would not return to sensual pleasures.  But when I did achieve that rapture and bliss, or something more peaceful than that,  I announced that I would not return to sensual pleasures.  And what is the gratification of sensual pleasures?  There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.  What five?  Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 15  Measuring Up  So I have heard.  At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile’s Bellow, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.  There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants:  “Reverends, mendicants!”  “Reverend,” they replied.  Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:  “Suppose a mendicant invites  other mendicants to admonish them. But they’re hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They're impatient, and don't take instruction respectfully. So their spiritual companions don’t think it’s worth advising and instructing them, and that individual doesn’t gain their trust.  And what are the qualities that make them hard to admonish?  Firstly, a mendicant has corrupt wishes, having fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.  This is a quality that makes them difficult to admonish.  Furthermore, a mendicant glorifies themselves and puts others down. …  They’re irritable, overcome by anger …  They’re irritable, and acrimonious due to anger …  They’re irritable, and stubborn due to anger …  They’re irritable, and blurt out words bordering on anger …  When accused, they object to the accuser …  When accused, they rebuke the accuser …  When accused, they retort to the accuser …  When accused, they dodge the issue, distract the discussion with irrelevant points, and display annoyance, hate, and bitterness …  When accused, they are unable to account for the evidence …  They are offensive and contemptuous …  They’re jealous and stingy …  They’re devious and deceitful …  They’re obstinate and arrogant …  Furthermore, a mendicant is attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.  This too is a quality that makes them difficult to admonish.  These are the qualities that make them hard to admonish.  Suppose a mendicant doesn’t invite  other mendicants to admonish them. But they’re easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They're accepting, and take instruction respectfully. So their spiritual companions think it’s worth advising and instructing them, and that individual gains their trust.  And what are the qualities that make them easy to admonish?  Firstly, a mendicant doesn’t have corrupt wishes …  Furthermore, a mendicant isn’t attached to their own views, not holding them tight, but letting them go easily.  These are the qualities that make them easy to admonish.  In such a case, a mendicant should measure themselves like this.  ‘This individual has corrupt wishes, having fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes. And I don’t like or approve of this individual.  And if I were to fall under the sway of corrupt wishes, others wouldn’t like or approve of me.’  A mendicant who knows this should give rise to the thought: ‘I will not fall under the sway of corrupt wishes.’ …  ‘This individual is attached to their own views, holding them tight and refusing to let go. And I don’t like or approve of this individual.  And if I were to be attached to my own views, holding them tight and refusing to let go, others wouldn’t like or approve of me.’  A mendicant who knows this should give rise to the thought: ‘I will not be attached to my own views, holding them tight, but will let them go easily.’  In such a case, a mendicant should check themselves like this:  ‘Do I have corrupt wishes? Have I fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes?’  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they have fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes. Then they should make an effort to give up those bad, unskillful qualities.  But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they haven’t fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities. …  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they are attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go. Then they should make an effort to give up those bad, unskillful qualities.  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they’re not attached to their own views, holding them tight, but let them go easily. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant sees that they haven’t given up all these bad, unskillful qualities. Then they should make an effort to give them all up.  But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant sees that they have given up all these bad, unskillful qualities. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.  Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they see any dirt or blemish there, they’d try to remove it.  But if they don’t see any dirt or blemish there, they’re happy, thinking:  ‘How fortunate that I’m clean!’  In the same way, suppose that, upon ",

What are the five kinds of hard-heartedness they haven’t given up?  Firstly, a mendicant has doubts about the Teacher. They’re uncertain, undecided, and lacking confidence.  This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving.  This is the first kind of hard-heartedness they haven’t given up.  Furthermore, a mendicant has doubts about the teaching …  This is the second kind of hard-heartedness.  They have doubts about the Saṅgha …  This is the third kind of hard-heartedness.  They have doubts about the training …  This is the fourth kind of hard-heartedness.  Furthermore, a mendicant is angry and upset with their spiritual companions, resentful and closed off.

This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving.  This is the first shackle of the heart they haven’t severed.  Furthermore, a mendicant isn’t free of greed for the body …  This is the second shackle of the heart.  Furthermore, a mendicant isn’t free of greed for form …  This is the third shackle of the heart.  They eat as much as they like until their belly is full, then indulge in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing …  This is the fourth heart shackle.  They lead the spiritual life hoping to be reborn in one of the orders of gods, thinking: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’  This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving.  This is the fifth shackle of the heart they haven’t severed.  These are the five shackles of the heart they haven’t severed.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition about jungle thickets.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, take the case of a mendicant who lives close by a jungle thicket.  As they do so, their mindfulness does not become established, their mind does not become immersed in samādhi, their defilements do not come to an end, and they do not arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.  And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are hard to come by.  That mendicant should reflect:  ‘While living close by this jungle thicket, my mindfulness does not become established, my mind does not become immersed in samādhi, my defilements do not come to an end, and I do not arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.  And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are hard to come by.’  That mendicant should leave that jungle thicket that very time of night or day; they should not stay there.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 18  The Honey-Cake  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms.  He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Great Wood for the day’s meditation,  plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood-apple tree to meditate.  Daṇḍapāṇi the Sakyan, while going for a walk,  plunged deep into the Great Wood. He approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side leaning on his staff, and said to the Buddha,  “What is the ascetic’s doctrine? What does he assert?”  “Good sir, my doctrine is such that one does not argue with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. And it is such that perceptions do not underlie the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without indecision, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state.  That is my doctrine, and that is what I assert.”  When he had spoken, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and left leaning on his staff.  Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, sat down on the seat spread out,  and told the mendicants what had happened.  When he had spoken, one of the mendicants said to him,  “But sir, asserting what doctrine does the Buddha not argue with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans?  And how is it that perceptions do not underlie the Buddha, the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without indecision, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state?”  “Mendicant, judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person.  If they don’t find anything worth approving, welcoming, or getting attached to in the source from which these arise,  just this is the end of the underlying tendencies to desire, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire for continued existence, and ignorance. This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword, the end of quarrels, arguments, and disputes, of accusations, divisive speech, and lies.  This is where these bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.”  That is what the Buddha said.  When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.  Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,  “The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail.  Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha?”  Then those mendicants thought,  “This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.  He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.  Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”  Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said:  “May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.”  “Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.  Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you bypassed him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.  For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.  That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.  You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”  “Certainly he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.  That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.  We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.  Still, Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.  You are capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 19  Two Kinds of Thought  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:  ‘Why don’t I meditate by continually dividing my thoughts into two classes?’  So I assigned sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts  to one class.  And I assigned thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness  to the second class.  Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a sensual thought arose.  I understood:  ‘This sensual thought has arisen in me.  It leads to hurting myself, hurting others, and hurting both. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.’  When I reflected that it leads to hurting myself, it went away.  When I reflected that it leads to hurting others, it went away.  When I reflected that it leads to hurting both, it went away.  When I reflected that it blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment, it went away.  So I gave up, got rid of, and eliminated any sensual thoughts that arose.  Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a malicious thought arose …  a cruel thought arose.  I understood:  ‘This cruel thought has arisen in me.  It leads to hurting myself, hurting others, and hurting both. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.’  When I reflected that it leads to hurting myself …  hurting others …  hurting both, it went away.  When I reflected that it blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment, it went away.  So I gave up, got rid of, and eliminated any cruel thoughts that arose.  Whatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers becomes their heart’s inclination.  If they often think about and consider sensual thoughts, they’ve given up the thought of renunciation to cultivate sensual thought. Their mind inclines to sensual thoughts.  If they often think about and consider malicious thoughts … their mind inclines to malicious thoughts.  If they often think about and consider cruel thoughts … their mind inclines to cruel thoughts.  Suppose it’s the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, when the crops grow closely together, and a cowherd must take care of the cattle.  He’d tap and poke them with his staff on this side and that to keep them in check.  Why is that?  For he sees that if they wander into the crops he could be executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned.  In the same way, I saw that unskillful qualities have the drawbacks of sordidness and corruption, and that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation.  Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a thought of renunciation arose.  I understood:  ‘This thought of renunciation has arisen in me.  It doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. It nourishes wisdom, it’s on the side of freedom from distress, and it leads to extinguishment.’  If I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night …  all day …  all night and day, I see no danger that would come from that.  Still, thinking and considering for too long would tire my body.  And when the body is tired, the mind is stressed.  And when the mind is stressed, it’s far from immersion.  So I stilled, settled, unified, and immersed my mind internally.  Why is that?  So that my mind would not be stressed.  Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a thought of good will arose …  a thought of harmlessness arose.  I understood:  ‘This thought of harmlessness has arisen in me.  It doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. It nourishes wisdom, it’s on the side of freedom from distress, and it leads to extinguishment.’  If I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night …  all day …  all night and day, I see no danger that would come from that.

If they often think about and consider thoughts of good will … their mind inclines to thoughts of good will.  If they often think about and consider thoughts of harmlessness … their mind inclines to thoughts of harmlessness.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 20  How to Stop Thinking  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, a mendicant committed to the higher mind should focus on five subjects from time to time.  What five?  Take a mendicant who is focusing on some subject that gives rise to bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion. That mendicant should focus on some other subject connected with the skillful.  As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  It’s like a deft mason or their apprentice who’d knock out or extract a large peg with a finer peg.  In the same way, a mendicant … should focus on some other basis of meditation connected with the skillful …  Now, suppose that mendicant is focusing on some other subject connected with the skillful, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts:  ‘So these thoughts are unskillful, they’re blameworthy, and they result in suffering.’  As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments. If the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted.  In the same way, a mendicant … should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts …  Now, suppose that mendicant is examining the drawbacks of those thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should try to forget and ignore them.  As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  Suppose there was a person with clear eyes, and some undesirable sights came into their range of vision.  They’d just close their eyes or look away.  In the same way, a mendicant … those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end …  Now, suppose that mendicant is ignoring and forgetting about those thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should focus on stopping the formation of thoughts.  As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  Suppose there was a person walking quickly.  They’d think:  ‘Why am I walking so quickly?  Why don’t I slow down?’  So they’d slow down.  They’d think:  ‘Why am I walking slowly?  Why don’t I stand still?’  So they’d stand still.  They’d think:  ‘Why am I standing still?  Why don’t I sit down?’  So they’d sit down.  They’d think:  ‘Why am I sitting?  Why don’t I lie down?’  So they’d lie down.  And so that person would shun successively coarser postures and adopt more subtle ones.  In the same way, a mendicant … those thoughts are given up and come to an end …  Now, suppose that mendicant is focusing on stopping the formation of thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up.  With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, they should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind.  As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  It’s like a strong man who grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them.  In the same way, a mendicant …  with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind.  As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  Now, take the mendicant who is focusing on some subject that gives rise to bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion. They focus on some other subject connected with the skillful …  They examine the drawbacks of those thoughts …  They try to forget and ignore about those thoughts …  They focus on stopping the formation of thoughts …  With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, they squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind. When they succeed in each of these things, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  This is called a mendicant who is a master of the ways of thought.  They will think what they want to think, and they won’t think what they don",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 21  The Simile of the Saw  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot was spending too long mixing closely with some nuns.  So much so that  if any mendicant criticized those nuns in his presence, Phagguna of the Top-Knot got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.  And if any mendicant criticized Phagguna of the Top-Knot in their presence, those nuns got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.  That’s how close Phagguna of the Top-Knot was with those nuns.  Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was going on.  So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,  “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot that  the teacher summons him.”  “Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Phagguna of the Top-Knot and said to him,  “Reverend Phagguna, the teacher summons you.”  “Yes, reverend,” Phagguna replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:  “Is it really true, Phagguna, that you’ve been spending too long mixing closely with some nuns?  So much so that  if any mendicant criticizes those nuns in your presence, you get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings?  And if any mendicant criticizes you in those nuns’ presence, they get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings?  Is that how close you’ve become with those nuns?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Phagguna, are you not a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness?”  “Yes, sir.”  “As such, it’s not appropriate for you to mix so closely with those nuns.  So if anyone criticizes those nuns in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.  If that happens, you should train like this:  ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’  That’s how you should train.  So even if someone strikes those nuns with fists, stones, rods, and swords in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.  If that happens, you should train like this:  ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’  That’s how you should train.  So if anyone criticizes you in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.  If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’  That’s how you should train.  So Phagguna, even if someone strikes you with fists, stones, rods, and swords, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.  If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’  That’s how you should train.”  Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:  “Mendicants, I used to be satisfied with the mendicants.  Once, I addressed them:  ‘I eat my food in one sitting per day.  Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  You too should eat your food in one sitting per day.  Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’  I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants;  I just had to prompt their mindfulness.  Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready.  A deft horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes.  In the same way, I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants;  I just had to prompt their mindfulness.  So, mendicants, you too should give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities.  In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training.  Suppose that not far from a town or village there was a large grove of sal trees  that was choked with castor-oil weeds.  Then along comes a person who wants to help protect and nurture that grove.  They’d cut down the crooked sal saplings that were robbing the sap, and throw them out. They’d clean up the interior of the grove,  and properly care for the straight, well-formed sal saplings.  In this way, in due course, that sal grove would grow, increase, and mature.  In the same way, mendicants, you too should give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities.  In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training.  Once upon a time, mendicants, right here in Sāvatthī there was a housewife named Vedehikā",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 22  The Simile of the Cobra  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time a mendicant called Ariṭṭha, who had previously been a vulture trapper, had the following harmful misconception:  “As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”  Several mendicants heard this rumour.  They went up to Ariṭṭha and said to him,  “Is it really true, Reverend Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception:  ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?”  “Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”  Then, wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him,  “Don’t say that, Ariṭṭha! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.  In many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them.  The Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.  With the similes of a skeleton …  a scrap of meat …  a grass torch …  a pit of glowing coals …  a dream …  borrowed goods …  fruit on a tree …  a butcher’s knife and chopping board …  swords and spears …  a snake’s head, the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.”  But even though the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him in this way, Ariṭṭha obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on it.  When they weren’t able to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.  So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,  “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture trapper, that  the teacher summons him.”  “Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Ariṭṭha and said to him,  “Reverend Ariṭṭha, the teacher summons you.”  “Yes, reverend,” Ariṭṭha replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,  “Is it really true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception:  ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?”  “Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”  “Futile man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way?  Haven’t I said in many ways that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them?  I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.  With the similes of a skeleton …  a scrap of meat …  a grass torch …  a pit of glowing coals …  a dream …  borrowed goods …  fruit on a tree …  a butcher’s knife and chopping board …  swords and spears …  a snake’s head, I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.  But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and brim with much wickedness.  This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”  Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,  “What do you think, mendicants?  Has this mendicant Ariṭṭha kindled even a spark of ardor in this teaching and training?”  “How could that be, sir?  No, sir.”  When this was said, Ariṭṭha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.  Knowing this, the Buddha said,  “Futile man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception.  I’ll question the mendicants about this.”  Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,  “Mendicants, do you understand my teaching as Ariṭṭha does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and brims with much wickedness?”  “No, sir.  For in many ways the Buddha has told us that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them.  The Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.  With the similes of a skeleton …  a snake’s head, the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.”  “Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this.  For in many ways I have said that obstructive acts are obstructive …  I’ve said tha",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 23  The Termite Mound  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was staying in the Dark Forest.  Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Dark Forest, went up to Kassapa the Prince, stood to one side, and said:  “Monk, monk! This termite mound fumes by night and flames by day.  The brahmin said,  ‘Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’  Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a sticking point:  ‘A sticking point, sir!’  The brahmin said,  ‘Throw out the sticking point!  Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’  Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a bullfrog:  ‘A bullfrog, sir!’  The brahmin said,  ‘Throw out the bullfrog!  Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’  Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a forked path:  ‘A forked path, sir!’  The brahmin said,  ‘Throw out the forked path!  Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’  Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a filter of ash:  ‘A filter of ash, sir!’  The brahmin said,  ‘Throw out the filter of ash!  Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’  Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a tortoise:  ‘A tortoise, sir!’  The brahmin said,  ‘Throw out the tortoise!  Dig, clever one, having taken up the sword!’  Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a butcher’s knife and chopping board:  ‘A butcher’s knife and chopping board, sir!’  The brahmin said,  ‘Throw out the butcher’s knife and chopping board!  Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’  Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a scrap of meat:  ‘A scrap of meat, sir!’  The brahmin said,  ‘Throw out the scrap of meat!  Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’  Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a cobra:  ‘A cobra, sir!’  The brahmin said,  ‘Leave the cobra! Do not disturb the cobra! Worship the cobra!’  Mendicant, go to the Buddha and ask him about this riddle. You should remember it in line with his answer.  I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to this riddle except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.”  That is what that deity said  before vanishing right there.  Then, when the night had passed, Kassapa the Prince went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he asked:  “Sir, what is the termite mound? What is the fuming by night and flaming by day? Who is the brahmin, and who the clever one? What are the sword, the digging, the sticking point, the bullfrog, the forked path, the filter of ash, the tortoise, the butcher’s knife and chopping board, and the scrap of meat? And what is the cobra?”  “Mendicant, ‘termite mound’ is a term for this body made up of the four principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.  Thinking and considering all night about what you did during the day— this is the fuming at night.  The work you apply yourself to during the day by body, speech, and mind after thinking about it all night— this is the flaming by day.  ‘Brahmin’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  ‘Clever one’ is a term for the trainee mendicant.  ‘Sword’ is a term for noble wisdom.  ‘Digging’ is a term for rousing energy.  ‘Sticking point’ is a term for ignorance.  ‘Throw out the sticking point’ means ‘give up ignorance,  dig, clever one, having picked up the sword.’  ‘Bullfrog’ is a term for anger and distress.  ‘Throw out the bullfrog’ means ‘give up anger and distress’ …  ‘A forked path’ is a term for doubt.  ‘Throw out the forked path’ means ‘give up doubt’ …  ‘A filter of ash’ is a term for the five hindrances, that is:  the hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.  ‘Throw out the filter of ash’ means ‘give up the five hindrances’ …  ‘Tortoise’ is a term for the five grasping aggregates, that is:  form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.  ‘Throw out the tortoise’ means ‘give up the five grasping aggregates’ …  ‘Butcher’s knife and chopping board’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.  Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  Sounds known by the ear …  Smells known by the nose …  Tastes known by the tongue …  Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  ‘Throw out the butcher’s knife and chopping board’ means ‘give up the five kinds of sensual stimulation’ …  ‘Scrap of meat’ is a term for greed and relishing.  ‘Throw out the s",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 24  Chariots at the Ready  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Then several mendicants who had completed the rainy season residence in their native land went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:  “In your native land, mendicants, which of the native mendicants is esteemed in this way:  ‘Personally having few wishes, they speak to the mendicants on having few wishes. Personally having contentment, seclusion, aloofness, energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom, they speak to the mendicants on all these things. They’re an adviser and counselor, one who educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires their spiritual companions.’”  “Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī, sir, is esteemed in this way in our native land.”  Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha.  Then he thought:  “Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī is fortunate, so very fortunate,  in that his sensible spiritual companions praise him point by point in the presence of the Teacher, and that the Teacher seconds that appreciation.  Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet Venerable Puṇṇa, and we can have a discussion.”  When the Buddha had stayed in Rājagaha as long as he pleased, he set out for Sāvatthī.  Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī,  where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Puṇṇa heard that the Buddha had arrived at Sāvatthī.  Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī.  Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.  The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.  Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, Puṇṇa got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.  Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and said to him,  “Reverend Sāriputta, the mendicant named Puṇṇa, of whom you have often spoken so highly, after being inspired by a talk of the Buddha’s, left for the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.”  Sāriputta quickly grabbed his sitting cloth and followed behind Puṇṇa, keeping sight of his head.  Puṇṇa plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.  And Sāriputta did likewise.  Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Puṇṇa, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Puṇṇa:  “Reverend, is our spiritual life lived under the Buddha?”  “Yes, reverend.”  “Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of ethics?”  “Certainly not.”  “Well, is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of mind?”  “Certainly not.”  “Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of view?”  “Certainly not.”  “Well, is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification by traversing doubt?”  “Certainly not.”  “Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path?”  “Certainly not.”  “Well, is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the practice?”  “Certainly not.”  “Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision?”  “Certainly not.”  “When asked each of these questions, you answered, ‘Certainly not.’  Then what exactly is the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha?”  “The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha is complete extinguishment with no fuel for grasping.”  “Reverend, is purification of ethics complete extinguishment with no fuel for grasping?”  “Certainly not, reverend.”  “Is purification of mind …  purification of view …  purification by traversing doubt …  purification of knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path …  purification of knowledge and vision of the practice …  Is purification of knowledge and vision complete extinguishment with no fuel for grasping?”  “Certainly not.”  “Then is complete extinguishment with no fuel for grasping something apart from these things?”  “Certainly not.”  “When asked each of these questions, you answered, ‘Certainly not.’  How then should we see the meaning of this statement?”  “If the Buddha had declared purification of ethics to be complete extinguishment with no fuel for grasping, he would have declared that which has fuel for grasping to be complete extinguishment with no fuel for grasping.  If the Buddha had declared purification of mind …  purification of view …  purification by traversing doubt …  purification of knowledge an",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 25  Sowing  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, a sower does not sow seed for deer thinking,  ‘May the deer, enjoying this seed, be long-lived and beautiful. May they live long and prosper!’  A sower sows seed for deer thinking,  ‘When these deer encroach on where I sow the seed, they’ll recklessly enjoy eating it. They’ll become indulgent, then they’ll become negligent, and then I’ll be able to do what I want with them on account of this seed.’  And indeed, the first herd of deer encroached on where the sower sowed the seed and recklessly enjoyed eating it. They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then the sower was able to do what he wanted with them on account of that seed.  And that’s how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the sower’s power.  So then a second herd of deer thought up a plan,  ‘The first herd of deer became indulgent …  and failed to get free of the sower’s power.  Why don’t we refrain from eating the seed altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’  And that’s just what they did.  But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin,  and they lost their strength and energy.  So they returned to where the sower had sown the seed.  Encroaching, they recklessly enjoyed eating it …  And that’s how the second herd of deer failed to get free from the sower’s power.  So then a third herd of deer thought up a plan,  ‘The first …  and second herds of deer …  failed to get free of the sower’s power.  Why don’t we set up our lair close by where the sower has sown the seed?  Then we can encroach and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then the sower won’t be able to do what he wants with us on account of that seed.’  And that’s just what they did.  So the sower and his helpers thought,  ‘Wow, this third herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of strange spirits with magical abilities!  For they eat the seed we’ve sown without us knowing how they come and go.  Why don’t we surround the seed on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see the lair where they go to hide out.’  And that’s just what they did.  And they saw the lair where the third herd of deer went to hide out.  And that’s how the third herd failed to get free from the sower’s power.  So then a fourth herd of deer thought up a plan,  ‘The first …  second …  and third herds of deer …  failed to get free of the sower’s power.  Why don’t we set up our lair somewhere the sower and his helpers can’t go? Then we can intrude on where the sower has sown the seed and enjoy eating it without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then the sower won’t be able to do with us what he wants on account of that seed.’  And that’s just what they did.  So the sower and his helpers thought,  ‘Wow, this fourth herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of strange spirits with magical abilities!  For they eat the seed we’ve sown without us knowing how they come and go.  Why don’t we surround the seed on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see the lair where they go to hide out.’  And that’s just what they did.  But they couldn’t see the lair where the fourth herd of deer went to hide out.  So the sower and his helpers thought,  ‘If we disturb this fourth herd of deer, they’ll disturb others, who in turn will disturb even more.  Then all of the deer will escape this seed we’ve sown.  Why don’t we just keep an eye on that fourth herd?’  And that’s just what they did.  And that’s how the fourth herd of deer escaped the sower’s power.  I’ve made up this simile to make a point.  And this is what it means.  ‘Seed’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.  ‘Sower’ is a term for Māra the Wicked.  ‘Sower’s helpers’ is a term for Māra’s assembly.  ‘Deer’ is a term for ascetics and brahmins.  Now, the first group of ascetics and brahmins encroached on where the seed and the worldly pleasures of the flesh were sown by Māra and recklessly enjoyed eating it.  They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then Māra was able to do what he wanted with them on account of that seed and the worldly pleasures of the flesh.  And that’s how the first group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māra’s power.  This first group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the first herd of deer, I say.  So then a second group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a plan,  ‘The first group of ascetics and brahmins became indulgent …  and failed to get free of Māra’s power.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 26  The Noble Quest  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.  Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and said to him,  “Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.  It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.”  “Well then, reverends, go to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage.  Hopefully you’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.”  “Yes, reverend,” they replied.  Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, the Buddha addressed Ānanda,  “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery for the day’s meditation.”  “Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.  So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Eastern Monastery for the day’s meditation.  In the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda,  “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.”  “Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.  So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe.  When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs.  Then Ānanda said to the Buddha,  “Sir, the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka is nearby.  It’s so delightful,  so lovely.  Please visit it out of sympathy.”  The Buddha consented with silence.  He went to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage.  Now at that time several mendicants were sitting together in the hermitage talking about the teaching.  The Buddha stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.  When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel.  The mendicants opened the door for the Buddha,  and he entered the hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out  and addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  “Sir, our unfinished discussion on the teaching was about the Buddha himself when the Buddha arrived.”  “Good, mendicants!  It’s appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit together and talk about the teaching.  When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:  discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.  Mendicants, there are these two quests:  the noble quest and the ignoble quest.  And what is the ignoble quest?  It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn seeks what is also liable to be reborn. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, they seek what is also liable to these things.  And what should be described as liable to be reborn?  Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to be reborn.  These attachments are liable to be reborn.  Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to being reborn, seeks what is also liable to be reborn.  And what should be described as liable to grow old?  Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to grow old.  These attachments are liable to grow old.  Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to grow old, seeks what is also liable to grow old.  And what should be described as liable to fall sick?  Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to fall sick.  These attachments are liable to fall sick.  Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to falling sick, seeks what is also liable to fall sick.  And what should be described as liable to die?  Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to die.  These attachments are liable to die.  Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to die, seeks what is also liable to die.  And what should be described as liable to sorrow?  Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to sorrow.  These attachments are liable to sorrow.  Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to sorrow, seeks what is also liable to sorrow.  And what should be described as liable to corruption?  Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to corruption.  These attachments are liable to corruption.  Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to corruption, seeks what is also liable to corruption.  This is the ignoble quest.  And wha",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 27  The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time the brahmin Jānussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by mares.  He saw the wanderer Pilotika coming off in the distance,  and said to him,  “So, worthy Vacchāyana, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”  “Just now, good fellow, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”  “What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? Do you think he’s astute?”  “My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom?  You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.”  “Mister Vacchāyana praises the ascetic Gotama with high praise indeed.”  “Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama?  He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans.”  “But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama?”  “Suppose that a skilled bull elephant tracker were to enter a bull elephant wood.  There he’d see a large elephant’s footprint, long and broad.  He would come to the conclusion,  ‘This must be a big bull elephant.’  In the same way, because I saw four footprints of the ascetic Gotama I came to the conclusion,  ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’  What four?  Firstly, I see some clever aristocrats who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect.  They hear,  ‘So, gentlemen, that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town.’  They formulate a question, thinking,  ‘We’ll approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this question.  If he answers like this, we’ll refute him like that;  and if he answers like that, we’ll refute him like this.’  When they hear that  he has come down  they approach him.  The ascetic Gotama educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires them with a Dhamma talk.  They don’t even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama, so how could they refute his answer?  Invariably, they become his disciples.  When I saw this first footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion,  ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’  Furthermore, I see some clever brahmins …  some clever householders …  they become his disciples.  Furthermore, I see some clever ascetics who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. …  They don’t even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama, so how could they refute his answer?  Invariably, they ask the ascetic Gotama for the chance to go forth.  And he gives them the going-forth.  Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.  They say,  ‘We were almost lost! We almost perished!  For we used to claim that we were ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones, but we were none of these things.  But now we really are ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones!’  When I saw this fourth footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion,  ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’  It’s because I saw these four footprints of the ascetic Gotama that I came to the conclusion,  ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’”  When he had spoken, Jānussoṇi got down from his chariot, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:  “Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!  Homage to him, the blessed one, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!  Homage to him, the blessed one, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!  Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet the worthy Gotama, and we can have a discussion.”  Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,  and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with the wanderer Pilotika.  When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,  “Brahmin, the simile of the elephant’s footprint is not yet completed in detail.  As to how it is completed in detail,  listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” Jānussoṇi replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Suppose a bull elephant tracker were to enter a bull elephant wood.  There they’d see a large elephant’s footprint, long and broad.  A skilled bull elephant tracker does not y",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 28  The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants,  “Reverends, mendicants!”  “Reverend,” they replied.  Sāriputta said this:  “The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint, so an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all.  In the same way, all skillful qualities are included in the four noble truths.  What four?  The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.  And what is the noble truth of suffering?  Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.  And what are the five grasping aggregates?  They are as follows: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.  And what is the grasping aggregate of form?  The four principal states, and form derived from the four principal states.  And what are the four principal states?  The elements of earth, water, fire, and air.  And what is the earth element?  The earth element may be interior or exterior.  And what is the interior earth element?  Anything internal, personal, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated. This includes:  head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces; or anything else internal, personal, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated.  This is called the interior earth element.  The interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth element.  This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’  When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the earth element, detaching the mind from the earth element.  There comes a time when the exterior water element flares up.  At that time the exterior earth element vanishes.  So for all its great age, the earth element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish.  What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving? Rather than ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they consider it to be none of these things.  If others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble that mendicant, they understand:  ‘This painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in me.  That’s dependent, not independent.  Dependent on what?  Dependent on contact.’  They see that contact, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.  Based on that element alone, their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided.  Others might treat that mendicant with disliking, loathing, and detestation,  striking them with fists, stones, sticks, and swords.  They understand:  ‘This body is such that fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike it.  But the Buddha has said in the Advice on the Simile of the Saw:  “Even if low-down bandits were to sever you limb from limb with a two-handed saw, anyone who had a malevolent thought on that account would not be following my instructions.”  My energy shall be roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness established and lucid, my body tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind immersed in samādhi and unified.  Gladly now, let fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike this body! For this is how the instructions of the Buddhas are followed.’  While recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful may not become stabilized in them.  In that case they stir up a sense of urgency:  ‘It’s my loss, my misfortune,  that while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does not become stabilized in me.’  They’re like a daughter-in-law who stirs up a sense of urgency when they see their father-in-law.  But if, while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them, they’re happy with that.  At this point, much has been done by that mendicant.  And what is the water element?  The water element may be interior or exterior.  And what is the interior water element?  Anything internal, personal, that’s water, watery, and appropriated. This includes:  bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine; or anything else internal, personal, that’s water, watery, and appropriated.  This is called the interior water element.  The interior water element and the exterior water element are just the water element.  This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 29  The Longer Simile of the Heartwood  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left.  There the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta:  “Mendicants, take the case of a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking,  ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.  Hopefully I can make an end to this entire mass of suffering.’  When they’ve gone forth they generate possessions, honor, and popularity.  They’re happy with that, and they’ve got all they wished for.  And they glorify themselves and put others down because of that:  ‘I’m the one with possessions, honor, and popularity. These other mendicants are obscure and insignificant.’  And so they become indulgent and fall into negligence on account of those possessions, honor, and popularity. And being negligent they live in suffering.  Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But, passing over the heartwood, softwood, bark, and shoots, he’d cut off the branches and leaves and leave imagining they were heartwood.  If a person with clear eyes saw him they’d say,  ‘This gentleman doesn’t know what heartwood, softwood, bark, shoots, or branches and leaves are.  That’s why he passed them over, cut off the branches and leaves, and left imagining they were heartwood.  Whatever he needs to make from heartwood, he won’t succeed.’ …  This is called a mendicant who has grabbed the branches and leaves of the spiritual life  and stopped short with that.  Next, take a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness …  When they’ve gone forth they generate possessions, honor, and popularity.  They’re not happy with that, and haven’t got all they wished for.  They don’t glorify themselves and put others down on account of that.  Nor do they become indulgent and fall into negligence on account of those possessions, honor, and popularity.  Being diligent, they achieve accomplishment in ethics.  They’re happy with that, and they’ve got all they wished for.  And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that:  ‘I’m the one who is ethical, of good character. These other mendicants are unethical, of bad character.’  And so they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding their accomplishment in ethics. And being negligent they live in suffering.

They’re happy with that, and they’ve got all they wished for.  And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that:  ‘I’m the one with immersion and unified mind.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 30  The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:  “Worthy Gotama, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and tutor a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people.  Namely: Pūraṇa Kassapa, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla, Ajita of the hair blanket, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan.  According to their own claims, did all of them have direct knowledge, or none of them, or only some?”  “Enough, brahmin, let this be:  ‘According to their own claims, did all of them have direct knowledge, or none of them, or only some?’  I will teach you the Dhamma.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” Piṅgalakoccha replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But, passing over the heartwood, softwood, bark, and shoots, he’d cut off the branches and leaves and leave imagining they were heartwood.  If a person with clear eyes saw him they’d say:  ‘This gentleman doesn’t know what heartwood, softwood, bark, shoots, or branches and leaves are.  That’s why he passed them over, cut off the branches and leaves, and left imagining they were heartwood.  Whatever he needs to make from heartwood, he won’t succeed.’  Suppose there was another person in need of heartwood … he’d cut off the shoots and leave imagining they were heartwood …  Suppose there was another person in need of heartwood … he’d cut off the bark and leave imagining it was heartwood …  Suppose there was another person in need of heartwood … he’d cut out the softwood and leave imagining it was heartwood …  Suppose there was another person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. He’d cut out just the heartwood and leave knowing it was heartwood.  If a person with clear eyes saw him they’d say:  ‘This gentleman knows what heartwood, softwood, bark, shoots, or branches and leaves are.  That’s why he cut out just the heartwood and left knowing it was heartwood.  Whatever he needs to make from heartwood, he will succeed.’  In the same way, take a certain individual who goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:  ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.  Hopefully I can make an end to this entire mass of suffering.’  When they’ve gone forth they generate possessions, honor, and popularity.  They’re happy with that, and they’ve got all they wished for.  And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that:  ‘I’m the one with possessions, honor, and popularity. These other mendicants are obscure and insignificant.’  They become lazy and slack on account of their possessions, honor, and popularity, not generating enthusiasm or trying to realize those things that are better and finer. …  They’re like the individual who mistakes branches and leaves for heartwood, I say.  Next, take an individual who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness …  When they’ve gone forth they generate possessions, honor, and popularity.  They’re not happy with that, and haven’t got all they wished for.  They don’t glorify themselves and put others down on account of that.  They don’t become lazy and slack regarding their possessions, honor, and popularity, but generate enthusiasm and try to realize those things that are better and finer.  They achieve accomplishment in ethics.  They’re happy with that, and they’ve got all they wished for.  And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that:  ‘I’m the one who is ethical, of good character. These other mendicants are unethical, of bad character.’  They become lazy and slack regarding their accomplishment in ethics, not generating enthusiasm or trying to realize those things that are better and finer. …  They’re like the individual who mistakes shoots for heartwood, I say.  Next, take an individual who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness …  They achieve accomplishment in ethics …  and immersion. …  They become lazy and slack regarding their accomplishment in immersion, not generating enthusiasm or trying to realize those things that are better and finer. …  They’re like the individual who mistakes bark for heartwood, I say.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 31  The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick house.  Now at that time the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga.  Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to that park.  The park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distance  and said to him,  “Don’t come into this park, ascetic.  There are three gentlemen staying here whose nature is to desire self-knowledge.  Do not disturb them.”  Anuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddha,  and said to him,  “Don’t keep the Buddha out, good park keeper!  Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.”  Then Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila, and said to them,  “Come forth, venerables, come forth! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived!”  Then Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila came out to greet the Buddha.  One received his bowl and robe, one spread out a seat, and one set out water for washing his feet.  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,  and washed his feet.  Those venerables bowed and sat down to one side.  The Buddha said to Anuruddha,  “I hope you’re keeping well, Anuruddha and friends; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”  “We’re keeping well, Blessed One, we’re getting by. And we have no trouble getting almsfood.”  “I hope you’re living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes?”  “Indeed, sir, we live in harmony like this.”  “But how do you live this way?”  “In this case, sir, I think,  ‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate,  to live together with spiritual companions such as these.’  I consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private.  I think,  ‘Why don’t I set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables’ ideas?’  And that’s what I do.  Though we’re different in body, sir, we’re one in mind, it seems to me.”  And the venerables Nandiya and Kimbila spoke likewise, and they added:  “That’s how we live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.”  “Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!  But I hope you’re living diligently, keen, and resolute?”  “Indeed, sir, we live diligently.”  “But how do you live this way?”  “In this case, sir, whoever returns first from almsround prepares the seats, and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin.  If there’s anything left over, whoever returns last eats it if they like. Otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.  Then they put away the seats, drinking water, and rubbish bin, and sweep the refectory.  If someone sees that the pot of water for washing, drinking, or the toilet is empty they set it up.  If he can’t do it, he summons another with a wave of the hand, and they set it up by lending each other a hand to lift. But we don’t break into speech for that reason.  And every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachings.  That’s how we live diligently, keen, and resolute.”  “Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!  But as you live diligently like this, have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation?”  “How could we not, sir?  Whenever we want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, we enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.  This is a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation, that we have achieved while living diligent, keen, and resolute.”  “Good, good!  But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?”  “How could we not, sir?  Whenever we want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, we enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.  This is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.”  “Good, good!  But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?”  “How could we not, sir?  Whenever we want, with the fading away of rapture, we enter and remain in the third absorption, where we meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’  This is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.”  “Good, good!  But have you achi",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 32  The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga, together with several well-known senior disciples, such as  the venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Anuruddha, Revata, Ānanda, and others.  Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahākassapa, and said,  “Come, Reverend Kassapa, let’s go to Venerable Sāriputta to hear the teaching.”  “Yes, reverend,” Mahākassapa replied.  Then, together with Venerable Anuruddha, they went to Sāriputta to hear the teaching.  Seeing them, Venerable Ānanda  went to Venerable Revata, told him what was happening,  and invited him also.  Sāriputta saw them coming off in the distance  and said to Ānanda,  “Come, Venerable Ānanda.  Welcome to Ānanda, the Buddha’s attendant, who is so close to the Buddha.  Ānanda, the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely, the night is bright, the sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to float on the air.  What kind of mendicant would grace this park?”  “Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and penetrating them theoretically.  And they teach the four assemblies in order to uproot the underlying tendencies with well-rounded and coherent words and phrases.  That’s the kind of mendicant who would grace this park.”  When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Revata,  “Reverend Revata, Ānanda has answered by speaking from his heart.  And now we ask you the same question.”  “Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who enjoys retreat and loves retreat. They’re committed to inner serenity of the heart, they don’t neglect absorption, they’re endowed with discernment, and they frequent empty huts.  That’s the kind of mendicant who would grace this park.”  When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Anuruddha,  “Reverend Anuruddha, Revata has answered by speaking from his heart.  And now we ask you the same question.”  “Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who surveys a thousandfold galaxy with clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human,  just as a person with clear eyes could survey a thousand orbits from the upper floor of a royal longhouse.  That’s the kind of mendicant who would grace this park.”  When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Mahākassapa,  “Reverend Kassapa, Anuruddha has answered by speaking from his heart.  And now we ask you the same question.”  “Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who lives in the wilderness, eats only almsfood, wears rag robes, and owns just three robes; and they praise these things. They are of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and they praise these things. They are accomplished in ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom; and they praise these things.  That’s the kind of mendicant who would grace this park.”  When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Mahāmoggallāna,  “Reverend Moggallāna, Mahākassapa has answered by speaking from his heart.  And now we ask you the same question.”  “Reverend Sāriputta, it’s when two mendicants engage in discussion about the teaching. They question each other and answer each other’s questions without faltering, and their discussion on the teaching flows on.  That’s the kind of mendicant who would grace this park.”  Then Mahāmoggallāna said to Sāriputta,  “Each of us has spoken from our heart.  And now we ask you:  Sāriputta, the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely, the night is bright, the sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to float on the air.  What kind of mendicant would grace this park?”  “Reverend Moggallāna, it’s when a mendicant masters their mind and is not mastered by it.  In the morning, they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want.  At midday,  and in the evening, they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want.  Suppose that a ruler or their chief minister had a chest full of garments of different colors.  In the morning, they’d don whatever pair of garments they wanted.  At midday,  and in the evening, they’d don whatever pair of garments they wanted.  In the same way, a mendicant masters their mind and is not mastered by it.  In the morning, they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want.  At midday,  and in the evening, they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want.  That’s the kind of mendicant who would grace this park.”  Then Sāriputta said to those venerables,  “Each of us has spoken from the heart.  Come, reverends, let’s go to the Buddha, and inform him about this.  As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”  “Yes, reverend,” they replied.  Then thos",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 33  The Longer Discourse on the Cowherd  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, a cowherd with eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle.  What eleven?  It’s when a cowherd doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t spread smoke, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in ranges, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to the bulls who are fathers and captains of the herd.  A cowherd with these eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle.  In the same way, a mendicant with eleven qualities can’t achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.  What eleven?  It’s when a mendicant doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t spread smoke, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in ranges, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha.  And how does a mendicant not know form?  It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand that all form is the four principal states, or form derived from the four principal states.  That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know form.  And how is a mendicant not skilled in characteristics?  It’s when a mendicant doesn’t understand that a fool is characterized by their deeds, and an astute person is characterized by their deeds.  That’s how a mendicant isn’t skilled in characteristics.  And how does a mendicant not pick out flies’ eggs?  It’s when a mendicant tolerates a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen. They tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen. They don’t give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.  That’s how a mendicant doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs.  And how does a mendicant not dress wounds?  When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they get caught up in the features and details.  Since the faculty of sight is left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure become overwhelming. They don’t practice restraint, they don’t protect the faculty of sight, and they don’t achieve its restraint.  When they hear a sound with their ears …  smell an odor with their nose …  taste a flavor with their tongue …  feel a touch with their body …  know an idea with their mind, they get caught up in the features and details.  Since the faculty of the mind is left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure become overwhelming. They don’t practice restraint, they don’t protect the faculty of the mind, and they don’t achieve its restraint.  That’s how a mendicant doesn’t dress wounds.  And how does a mendicant not spread smoke?  It’s when a mendicant doesn’t teach others the Dhamma in detail as they learned and memorized it.  That’s how a mendicant doesn’t spread smoke.  And how does a mendicant not know the ford?  It’s when a mendicant doesn’t from time to time go up to those mendicants who are very learned—inheritors of the heritage, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—and ask them questions:  ‘Why, sir, does it say this?  What does that mean?’  Those venerables don’t reveal what is hidden, clarify what is unclear, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters.  That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know the ford.  And how does a mendicant not know satisfaction?  It’s when a mendicant, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, finds no inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and finds no joy connected with the teaching.  That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know satisfaction.  And how does a mendicant not know the trail?  It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand the noble eightfold path.  That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know the trail.  And how is a mendicant not skilled in ranges?  It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.  That’s how a mendicant is not skilled in ranges.  And how does a mendicant milk dry?  It’s when a mendicant is invited by a householder to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, and that mendicant doesn’t know moderation in accepting.  That’s how a mendicant milks dry.  And how does a mendicant not show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha?  It’s when a mendicant doesn’t consistently treat senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 34  The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Once upon a time, mendicants, there was an unintelligent Magadhan cowherd. In the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, without inspecting the near shore or the far shore, he drove his cattle across a place with no ford on the Ganges river to the northern shore among the Suvidehans.  But the cattle bunched up in mid-stream and came to ruin right there.  Why is that?  Because the unintelligent cowherd failed to inspect the shores before driving the cattle across at a place with no ford.  In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who are unskilled in this world and the other world, unskilled in Māra’s dominion and its opposite, and unskilled in Death’s dominion and its opposite. If anyone thinks they are worth listening to and trusting, it will be for their lasting harm and suffering.  Once upon a time, mendicants, there was an intelligent Magadhan cowherd. In the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, after inspecting the near shore and the far shore, he drove his cattle across a ford on the Ganges river to the northern shore among the Suvidehans.  First he drove across the bulls, the fathers and captains of the herd.  They breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore.  Then he drove across the strong and tractable cattle.  They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore.  Then he drove across the bullocks and heifers.  They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore.  Then he drove across the calves and weak cattle.  They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore.  Once it happened that a baby calf had just been born. Urged on by its mother’s lowing, even it managed to breast the stream of the Ganges and safely reach the far shore.  Why is that?  Because the intelligent cowherd inspected both shores before driving the cattle across at a ford.  In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who are skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in Māra’s dominion and its opposite, and skilled in Death’s dominion and its opposite. If anyone thinks they are worth listening to and trusting, it will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.  Just like the bulls, fathers and captains of the herd, who crossed the Ganges to safety  are the mendicants who are perfected, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their heart’s goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment. Having breasted Māra’s stream, they have safely crossed over to the far shore.  Just like the strong and tractable cattle who crossed the Ganges to safety  are the mendicants who, with the ending of the five lower fetters, are reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore.  Just like the bullocks and heifers who crossed the Ganges to safety  are the mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore.  Just like the calves and weak cattle who crossed the Ganges to safety  are the mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, destined for awakening. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore.  Just like the baby calf who had just been born, but, urged on by its mother’s lowing, still managed to cross the Ganges to safety  are the mendicants who are followers of teachings, followers by faith. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore.  Mendicants, I am skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in Māra’s dominion and its opposite, and skilled in Death’s dominion and its opposite. If anyone thinks I am worth listening to and trusting, it will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”  That is what the Buddha said.  Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:  “This world and the other world  have been clearly explained by one who knows;  as well as Māra’s reach,  and what’s out of Death’s reach.  Directly knowing the whole world,  the Buddha who understands  has opened the door to freedom from death,  for finding the sanctuary, extinguishment.  The Wicked One’s stream has been cut,  it’s blown away and mown down.  Be full of joy, mendicants,  set your heart on sanctuary!” ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 35  The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.  Now at that time Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was staying in Vesālī. He was a controversialist who pretended to be astute and was deemed holy by many people.  He was telling a crowd in Vesālī,  “I don’t see any ascetic or brahmin who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits, were I to take them on in debate—not a leader of an order or a community, or the tutor of a community, and not even one who claims to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.  Even an insentient post would shake and rock and tremble were I to take it on in debate.  How much more then a human being!”  Then Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.  As Saccaka was going for a walk he saw Assaji coming off in the distance.  He approached him and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Saccaka stood to one side and said to Assaji,  “Worthy Assaji, how does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples? And on what topics does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”  “Aggivessana, this is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and his instructions to disciples generally proceed on these topics:  ‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.  Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.  All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.’  This is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and how instruction to his disciples generally proceeds.”  “It’s sad to hear, worthy Assaji, that the ascetic Gotama has such a doctrine.  Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet the worthy Gotama, and we can have a discussion. And hopefully I can dissuade him from this harmful misconception.”  Now at that time around five hundred Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall on some business.  Then Saccaka went up to them and said,  “Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama.  If he stands by the position stated to me by one of his well-known disciples—a mendicant named Assaji—I’ll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would grab a fleecy sheep and drag it to and fro and round about!  Taking him on in debate, I’ll drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep lake, grab it by the corners, and drag it to and fro and round about!  Taking him on in debate, I’ll shake him down and about, and give him a beating, like a strong brewer’s mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about, and give it a beating!  I’ll play a game of hemp-washing with the ascetic Gotama, like a sixty-year-old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of hemp-washing!  Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama.”  At that, some of the Licchavis said,  “How can the ascetic Gotama refute Saccaka’s doctrine, when it is Saccaka who will refute Gotama’s doctrine?”  But some of the Licchavis said,  “Who is Saccaka to refute the Buddha’s doctrine, when it is the Buddha who will refute Saccaka’s doctrine?”  Then Saccaka, escorted by the five hundred Licchavis, went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.  At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.  Then Saccaka went up to them and said,  “Good fellows, where is the worthy Gotama at present?  For we want to see him.”  “Aggivessana, the Buddha has plunged deep into the Great Wood and is sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.”  Then Saccaka, together with a large group of Licchavis, went to see the Buddha in the Great Wood, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.  Before sitting down to one side, some of the Licchavīs bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.  Then Saccaka said to the Buddha,  “I’d like to ask the worthy Gotama about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”  “Ask what you wish, Aggivessana.”  “How does the worthy Gotama guide his disciples? And on what topics does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”  “This is how I guide my disciples, and my instructions to disciples generally proceed on these topics:  ‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.  Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.  All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.’  This is how I guide my disciples, and how instruction to my disciples generally proceeds.”  “A simile strikes me,",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 36  The Longer Discourse With Saccaka  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.  Now at that time in the morning the Buddha, being properly dressed, took his bowl and robe, wishing to enter Vesālī for alms.  Then as Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was going for a walk he approached the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.  Venerable Ānanda saw him coming off in the distance,  and said to the Buddha,  “Sir, Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, is coming. He’s a controversialist who pretends to be astute and is deemed holy by many people.  He wants to discredit the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.  Please, sir, sit for an hour out of sympathy.”  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out.  Then Saccaka went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,  “Worthy Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing physical endurance, without developing the mind.  They suffer painful physical feelings.  This happened to someone once. Their thighs became paralyzed, their heart burst, hot blood gushed from their mouth, and they went mad and lost their mind.  Their mind was subject to the body, and the body had power over it.  Why is that?  Because their mind was not developed.  There are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing the mind, without developing physical endurance.  They suffer painful mental feelings.  This happened to someone once. Their thighs became paralyzed, their heart burst, hot blood gushed from their mouth, and they went mad and lost their mind.  Their body was subject to the mind, and the mind had power over it.  Why is that?  Because their physical endurance was not developed.  It occurs to me that  The worthy Gotama’s disciples must live committed to the practice of developing the mind, without developing physical endurance.”  “But Aggivessana, what have you heard about the development of physical endurance?”  “Take, for example,  Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla.  They go naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.  They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a hound waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.  They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.  They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.  They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.”  “But Aggivessana, do they get by on so little?”  “No, worthy Gotama.  Sometimes they eat luxury fresh and cooked foods and drink a variety of luxury beverages.  They gather their body’s strength, build it up, and get fat.”  “What they earlier gave up, they later got back. That is how there is the increase and decrease of this body.  But Aggivessana, what have you heard about development of the mind?”  When Saccaka was questioned by the Buddha about development of the mind, he was stumped.  So the Buddha said to Saccaka,  “The development of physical endurance that you have described is not the legitimate development of physical endurance in the noble one’s training.  And since you don’t even understand the development of physical endurance, how can you possibly understand the development of the mind?  Still, as to how someone is undeveloped in physical endurance and mind, and how someone is developed in physical endurance and mind,  listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied Saccaka.  The Buddha said this:  “And how is someone undeveloped in physical endurance and mind?  Take an unlearned ordinary person who has a pleasant feeling.  When they experience a pleasant feeling they become full of lust for it.  Then that pleasant feeling ceases.  And when it ceases, a painful feeling arises.  When they suffer painful feeling, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.  Because their physical endurance is undeveloped, pleasant feelings occupy the mind. And because their mind is undeveloped, painful feelings occupy the mind.  Anyone whose mind is occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is undeveloped both in physical endurance and in mind.  And how is someone developed in physical endurance and",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 37  The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.  And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:  “Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?”  “lord of gods, take a mendicant who has heard:  ‘Nothing is worth insisting on.’  When a mendicant has heard that  nothing is worth insisting on,  they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Completely understanding all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral— they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.  Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.  Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.  They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’  That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.”  Then Sakka, lord of gods, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.  Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha.  He thought,  “Did that spirit comprehend what the Buddha said when he agreed with him, or not?  Why don’t I find out?”  And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern Monastery and reappeared among the gods of the thirty-three.  Now at that time Sakka was amusing himself in the Single Lotus Park, supplied and provided with a heavenly orchestra.  Seeing Mahāmoggallāna coming off in the distance,  he waved off the orchestra, approached Mahāmoggallāna, and said,  “Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, good fellow!  It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.  Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.”  Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the seat spread out,  while Sakka took a low seat and sat to one side.  Mahāmoggallāna said to him,  “Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of craving?  Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.”  “My good Moggallāna, I have many duties, and much to do,  not only for myself, but also for the gods of the thirty-three.  Still, what is properly heard, learned, attended, and memorized does not vanish all of a sudden.  Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the titans.  In that battle the gods won and the titans lost.  When I returned from that battle as a conqueror, I created the Palace of Victory.  The Palace of Victory has a hundred towers.  Each tower has seven hundred chambers.  Each chamber has seven nymphs.  Each nymph has seven maids.  Would you like to see the lovely Palace of Victory?”  Mahāmoggallāna consented with silence.  Then, putting Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in front, Sakka, lord of gods, and Vessavaṇa, the Great King, went to the Palace of Victory.  When they saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, Sakka’s maids,  being discreet and prudent, each went to her own bedroom.  They were just like a daughter-in-law who is discreet and prudent when they see their father-in-law.  Then Sakka and Vessavaṇa encouraged Moggallāna to wander and explore the palace, saying,  “See, in the palace, my good Moggallāna, this lovely thing!  And that lovely thing!”  “That looks beautiful for the venerable Kosiya, as befits one who has made merit in the past.  Humans, when they see something lovely, also say:  ‘It looks beautiful enough for the gods of the thirty-three!’  That looks beautiful for the venerable Kosiya, as befits one who has made merit in the past.”  Then Moggallāna thought,  “This spirit lives much too negligently.  Why don’t I stir up a sense of urgency in him?”  Then Moggallāna used his psychic power to make the Palace of Victory shake and rock and tremble with his big toe.  Then Sakka, Vessavaṇa, and the gods of the thirty-three, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,  “Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!  The ascetic has such power and might that he makes the god’s home shake and rock and tremble with his big toe!”  Knowing that Sakka was shocked and awestruck, Moggallāna said to him,  “Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of craving?

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 38  The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time a mendicant called Sāti, the fisherman’s son, had the following harmful misconception:  “As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”  Several mendicants heard this rumour.  They went up to Sāti and said to him,  “Is it really true, Reverend Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception:  ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”  “Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”  Then, wishing to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him,  “Don’t say that, Sāti! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.  In many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.”  But even though the mendicants pressed him in this way, Sāti obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on it.  When they weren’t able to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.  So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,  “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Sāti that  the teacher summons him.”  “Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāti and said to him,  “Reverend Sāti, the teacher summons you.”  “Yes, reverend,” Sāti replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,  “Is it really true, Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception:  ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”  “Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”  “Sāti, what is that consciousness?”  “Sir, he is the one who speaks, the one who knows, who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms.”  “Futile man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way?  Haven’t I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause?  But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and brim with much wickedness.  This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”  Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,  “What do you think, mendicants?  Has this mendicant Sāti kindled even a spark of ardor in this teaching and training?”  “How could that be, sir?  No, sir.”  When this was said, Sāti sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.  Knowing this, the Buddha said,  “Futile man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception.  I’ll question the mendicants about this.”  Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,  “Mendicants, do you understand my teachings as Sāti does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and brims with much wickedness?”  “No, sir.  For in many ways the Buddha has told us that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.”  “Good, good, mendicants!  It’s good that you understand my teaching like this.  For in many ways I have told you that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.  But still this Sāti misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and brims with much wickedness.  This will be for his lasting harm and suffering.  Consciousness is reckoned according to the very same condition dependent upon which it arises.  Consciousness that arises dependent on the eye and sights is reckoned as eye consciousness.  Consciousness that arises dependent on the ear and sounds is reckoned as ear consciousness.  Consciousness that arises dependent on the nose and smells is reckoned as nose consciousness.  Consciousness that arises dependent on the tongue and tastes is reckoned as tongue consciousness.  Consciousness that arises dependent on the body and touches is reckoned as body consciousness.  Consciousness that arises dependent on the mind and ideas is reckoned as mind consciousness.  It’s like fire, which is reckoned according to the very same condition dependent upon which it burns.  A fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fire.  A fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fire.  A fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fire.  A fire that burns dependent on cow-dung is reckoned as a cow-dung fire.  A fire that burns dependent on husks is reckoned as a husk fire.  A fire that burns dependent on rubbish is reckoned as",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 39  The Longer Discourse at Assapura  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas, near the Aṅgan town named Assapura.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, people label you as ascetics.  And when they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics.  Given this label and this claim, you should train like this: ‘We will undertake and follow the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct.  The services of those whose robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick we enjoy shall be very fruitful and beneficial for them. And our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.’  And what are the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin?  You should train like this: ‘We will have conscience and prudence.’  Now, mendicants, you might think,  ‘We have conscience and prudence. This is sufficient; enough has been done. We have achieved the goal of life as an ascetic. There is nothing more to do.’ And you might rest content with just that much.  I declare this to you, mendicants, I announce this to you:  ‘You who seek to be true ascetics, do not lose sight of the goal of the ascetic life while there is still more to do.’  What more is there to do?  You should train like this: ‘Our bodily behavior will be pure, clear, open, neither inconsistent nor secretive.  And we won’t glorify ourselves or put others down on account of our pure bodily behavior.’  Now, mendicants, you might think,  ‘We have conscience and prudence, and our bodily behavior is pure.

You should train like this: ‘Our verbal behavior …  mental behavior …  livelihood will be pure, clear, open, neither inconsistent nor secretive.  And we won’t glorify ourselves or put others down on account of our pure livelihood.’  Now, mendicants, you might think,  ‘We have conscience and prudence, our bodily, verbal, and mental behavior is pure, and our livelihood is pure.

I declare this to you, mendicants, I announce this to you:  ‘You who seek to be true ascetics, do not lose sight of the goal of the ascetic life while there is still more to do.’  What more is there to do?  You should train yourselves like this: ‘We will restrain our sense doors.  When we see a sight with our eyes, we won’t get caught up in the features and details.  If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, we will practice restraint, we will protect the faculty of sight, and we will achieve its restraint.  When we hear a sound with our ears …  When we smell an odor with our nose …  When we taste a flavor with our tongue …  When we feel a touch with our body …  When we know an idea with our mind, we won’t get caught up in the features and details.  If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, we will practice restraint, we will protect the faculty of mind, and we will achieve its restraint.’  Now, mendicants, you might think,  ‘We have conscience and prudence, our bodily, verbal, and mental behavior is pure, our livelihood is pure, and our sense doors are restrained.  This is sufficient …’  What more is there to do?  You should train yourselves like this: ‘We will not eat too much. We will only eat after reflecting rationally on our food.  We will eat not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, we shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and we will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’  Now, mendicants, you might think,  ‘We have conscience and prudence, our bodily, verbal, and mental behavior is pure, our livelihood is pure, our sense doors are restrained, and we don’t eat too much.  This is sufficient …’  What more is there to do?  You should train yourselves like this: ‘We will be dedicated to wakefulness. When practicing walking and sitting meditation by day, we will purify our mind from obstacles.  In the first watch of the night, we will continue to practice walking and sitting meditation.  In the middle watch, we will lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 40  The Shorter Discourse at Assapura  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas, near the Aṅgan town named Assapura.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, people label you as ascetics.  And when they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics.  Given this label and this claim, you should train like this: ‘We will practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct.  The services of those whose robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick we enjoy shall be very fruitful and beneficial for them. And our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.’  And how does a mendicant not practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic?  Any mendicant who has not given up covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view  is not practicing in the way that is proper for an ascetic, I say. And that is due to not giving up these stains, defects, and dregs of an ascetic, these grounds for rebirth in places of loss, to be experienced in bad places.  I say that such a mendicant’s going forth may be compared to the kind of weapon called ‘deadborn’—double-edged, whetted with yellow arsenic—that has been covered and wrapped in an outer robe.  I say that you don’t deserve the label ‘outer robe wearer’ just because you wear an outer robe.  You don’t deserve the label ‘naked ascetic’ just because you go naked.  You don’t deserve the label ‘dust and dirt wearer’ just because you’re caked in dust and dirt.  You don’t deserve the label ‘water immerser’ just because you immerse yourself in water.  You don’t deserve the label ‘tree root dweller’ just because you stay at the root of a tree.  You don’t deserve the label ‘open air dweller’ just because you stay in the open air.  You don’t deserve the label ‘stander’ just because you continually stand.  You don’t deserve the label ‘interval eater’ just because you eat food at set intervals.  You don’t deserve the label ‘reciter’ just because you recite hymns.  You don’t deserve the label ‘matted-hair ascetic’ just because you have matted hair.  Imagine that just by wearing an outer robe someone with covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view could give up these things. If that were the case, your friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would make you an outer robe wearer as soon as you were born. They’d encourage you:  ‘Please, dearest, wear an outer robe! By doing so you will give up covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view.’  But sometimes I see someone with these bad qualities who is an outer robe wearer. That’s why I say that you don’t deserve the label ‘outer robe wearer’ just because you wear an outer robe.  Imagine that just by going naked …  wearing dust and dirt …  immersing in water …  staying at the root of a tree …  staying in the open air …  standing continually …  eating at set intervals …  reciting hymns …  having matted hair someone with covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view could give up these things. If that were the case, your friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would make you a matted-hair ascetic as soon as you were born. They’d encourage you:  ‘Please, dearest, become a matted-hair ascetic! By doing so you will give up covetousness, ill will, irritability, hostility, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view.’  But sometimes I see someone with these bad qualities who is a matted-hair ascetic. That’s why I say that you don’t deserve the label ‘matted-hair ascetic’ just because you have matted hair.  And how does a mendicant practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic?  Any mendicant who has given up covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view  is practicing in the way that is proper for an ascetic, I say. And that is due to giving up these stains, defects, and dregs of an ascetic, these grounds for rebirth in places of loss, to be experienced in bad places.  They see themselves purified from all these bad, unskillful qualities.  Seeing this, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.  They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same w",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 41  The People of Sālā  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā.  The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard,  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased.  He reveals an entirely full and pure spiritual life.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha:  “What is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?  And what is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”  “Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.  Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”  “We don’t understand the detailed meaning of the worthy Gotama’s brief statement.  Worthy Gotama, please teach us this matter in detail so we can understand the meaning.”  “Well then, householders, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Householders, unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.  And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of body?  It’s when a certain person kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.  They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.  They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.  This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body.  And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct fourfold by way of speech?  It’s when a certain person lies. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, worthy man, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.  They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division.  They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion.  They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless.  This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is fourfold by way of speech.  And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of mind?  It’s when a certain person is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’  They have ill will and malicious intentions: ‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’  They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted:  ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or res",

Now at that time the brahmins and householders of Verañjā were residing in Sāvatthī on some business.  The brahmins and householders of Verañjā heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  He has this good reputation …  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  … They said to the Buddha:  “What is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?  And what is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”  “Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.  Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”  “We don’t understand the detailed meaning of the worthy Gotama’s brief statement. …”  “Householders, a person of unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind. …” … ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 43  The Great Elaboration  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta:  “Reverend, they speak of ‘a witless person’.  How is a witless person defined?”  “Reverend, they’re called witless because they don’t understand.  And what don’t they understand?  They don’t understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’  They’re called witless because they don’t understand.”  Saying “Good, reverend,” Mahākoṭṭhita approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said. Then he asked another question:  “They speak of ‘a wise person’.  How is a wise person defined?”  “They’re called wise because they understand.  And what do they understand?  They understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’  They’re called wise because they understand.”  “They speak of ‘consciousness’.  How is consciousness defined?”  “It’s called consciousness because it cognizes.  And what does it cognize?  It cognizes ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ and ‘neutral’.  It’s called consciousness because it cognizes.”  “Wisdom and consciousness— are these things mixed or separate?  And can we completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them?”  “Wisdom and consciousness— these things are mixed, not separate.  And you can never completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them.  For you understand what you cognize, and you cognize what you understand.  That’s why these things are mixed, not separate.  And you can never completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them.”  “Wisdom and consciousness— what is the difference between these things that are mixed, not separate?”  “The difference between these things is that wisdom should be developed, while consciousness should be completely understood.”  “They speak of this thing called ‘feeling’.  How is feeling defined?”  “It’s called feeling because it feels.  And what does it feel?  It feels pleasure, pain, and neutral.  It’s called feeling because it feels.”  “They speak of this thing called ‘perception’.  How is perception defined?”  “It’s called perception because it perceives.  And what does it perceive?  It perceives blue, yellow, red, and white.  It’s called perception because it perceives.”  “Feeling, perception, and consciousness— are these things mixed or separate?  And can we completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them?”  “Feeling, perception, and consciousness— these things are mixed, not separate.  And you can never completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them.  For you perceive what you feel, and you cognize what you perceive.  That’s why these things are mixed, not separate.  And you can never completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them.”  “What can be known by purified mind consciousness released from the five senses?”  “Aware that ‘space is infinite’ it can know the dimension of infinite space. Aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’ it can know the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that ‘there is nothing at all’ it can know the dimension of nothingness.”  “How do you understand something that can be known?”  “You understand something that can be known with the eye of wisdom.”  “What is the purpose of wisdom?”  “The purpose of wisdom is direct knowledge, complete understanding, and giving up.”  “How many conditions are there for the arising of right view?”  “There are two conditions for the arising of right view:  the voice of another and rational application of mind.  These are the two conditions for the arising of right view.”  “When right view is supported by how many factors does it have freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefit?”  “When right view is supported by five factors it has freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefit.  It’s when right view is supported by ethics, learning, discussion, serenity, and discernment.  When right view is supported by these five factors it has freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefit.”  “How many states of existence are there?”  “Reverend, there are these three states of existence.  Existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, and the formless realm.”  “But how is there regeneration into a new state of existence in the future?”  “It’s because of sentient beings—shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving—taking pleasure wherever they land.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 44  The Shorter Elaboration  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Then the layman Visākha went to see the nun Dhammadinnā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her:  “Ma’am, they speak of this thing called ‘substantial reality’.  What is this substantial reality that the Buddha spoke of?”  “Visākha, the Buddha said that these five grasping aggregates are substantial reality.  That is, the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.  The Buddha said that these five grasping aggregates are substantial reality.”  Saying “Good, ma’am,” Visākha approved and agreed with what Dhammadinnā said. Then he asked another question:  “Ma’am, they speak of this thing called ‘the origin of substantial reality’.  What is the origin of substantial reality that the Buddha spoke of?”  “It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure wherever it lands. That is,  craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for nonexistence.  The Buddha said that this is the origin of substantial reality.”  “Ma’am, they speak of this thing called ‘the cessation of substantial reality’.  What is the cessation of substantial reality that the Buddha spoke of?”  “It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not clinging to it.  The Buddha said that this is the cessation of substantial reality.”  “Ma’am, they speak of the practice that leads to the cessation of substantial reality.  What is the practice that leads to the cessation of substantial reality that the Buddha spoke of?”  “The practice that leads to the cessation of substantial reality that the Buddha spoke of is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:  right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.”  “But ma’am, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”  “That grasping is not the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates. Nor is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another.  The desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates is the grasping there.”  “But ma’am, how does substantialist view come about?”  “It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.  They regard feeling …  perception …  choices …  consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.  That’s how substantialist view comes about.”  “But ma’am, how does substantialist view not come about?”  “It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.  They don’t regard feeling …  perception …  choices …  consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.  That’s how substantialist view does not come about.”  “But ma’am, what is the noble eightfold path?”  “It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:  right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.”  “But ma’am, is the noble eightfold path conditioned or unconditioned?”  “The noble eightfold path is conditioned.”  “Are the three spectrums of practice included in the noble eightfold path? Or is the noble eightfold path included in the three practice categories?”  “The three spectrums of practice are not included in the noble eightfold path. Rather, the noble eightfold path is included in the three practice categories.  Right speech, right action, and right livelihood: these things are included in the spectrum of ethics.  Right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion: these things are included in the spectrum of immersion.  Right view and right thought: these things are included in the spectrum of wisdom.”  “But ma’am, what is immersion? What things are the bases of immersion? What things are the prerequisites for immersion? What is the development of immersion?”  “Unification of the mind is immersion.  The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the bases for immersion.  The four right efforts are the prerequisites for immersion.  The cultivation, development, and making much of these very same things is the development of immersion.”  “How many processes are there?”  “There are these three proc",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 45  The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, there are these four ways of taking up practices.  What four?  There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain.  There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.  There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure.  There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.  And what is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain?  There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:  ‘There’s nothing wrong with sensual pleasures.’  They throw themselves into sensual pleasures,  cavorting with female wanderers with jeweled bands in their hair.  They say,  ‘What future danger do those ascetics and brahmins see in sensual pleasures that they speak of giving up sensual pleasures, and advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasures?  Pleasant is the touch of this female wanderer’s arm, tender, soft, and downy!’ And they throw themselves into sensual pleasures.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.  And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.  They say,  ‘This is that future danger that those ascetics and brahmins saw. For it is because of sensual pleasures that I’m feeling painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.’  Suppose that in the last month of summer a camel’s foot creeper pod were to burst open  and a seed were to fall at the root of a sal tree.  Then the deity haunting that sal tree would become apprehensive and nervous.  But their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin—deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees—would come together to reassure them,  ‘Do not fear, sir, do not fear!  Hopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock, or eaten by a deer, or burnt by a forest fire, or picked up by a lumberjack, or eaten by termites, or it may not even be fertile.’  But none of these things happened. And the seed was fertile, so that when the monsoon clouds soaked it with rain, it sprouted.  And the creeper wound its tender, soft, and downy tendrils around that sal tree.  Then the deity thought,  ‘What future danger did my friends see when they said:  “Do not fear, sir, do not fear!  Hopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock, or eaten by a deer, or burnt by a forest fire, or picked up by a lumberjack, or eaten by termites, or it may not even be fertile.”  Pleasant is the touch of this creeper’s tender, soft, and downy tendrils.’  Then the creeper enfolded the sal tree,  made a canopy over it,  draped a curtain around it,  and split apart all the main branches.  Then the deity thought,  ‘This is the future danger that my friends saw!  It’s because of that camel’s foot creeper seed that I’m feeling painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.’  In the same way, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘There’s nothing wrong with sensual pleasures’ …  This is called the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain.  And what is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain?  It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.  They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a hound waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.  They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.  They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.  They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.  They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.  They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.  They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice.",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 46  The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, sentient beings typically have the wish, desire, and hope:  ‘Oh, if only unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things would decrease, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things would increase!’  But exactly the opposite happens to them.  What do you take to be the reason for this?”  “Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”  “Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They don’t know what practices they should cultivate and foster, and what practices they shouldn’t cultivate and foster.  So they cultivate and foster practices they shouldn’t, and don’t cultivate and foster practices they should.  When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things increase, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things decrease.  Why is that?  Because that’s what it’s like for someone who doesn’t know.  But a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They know what practices they should cultivate and foster, and what practices they shouldn’t cultivate and foster.  So they cultivate and foster practices they should, and don’t cultivate and foster practices they shouldn’t.  When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things decrease, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things increase.  Why is that?  Because that’s what it’s like for someone who knows.  Mendicants, there are these four ways of taking up practices.  What four?  There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.  There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain.  There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure.  There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.  When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain, an ignoramus, without knowing this, doesn’t truly understand:  ‘This is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.’  So instead of avoiding that practice, they cultivate it.  When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things increase, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things decrease.  Why is that?  Because that’s what it’s like for someone who doesn’t know.  When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pain, an ignoramus …  cultivates it …  and disagreeable things increase …  When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pleasure, an ignoramus …  doesn’t cultivate it …  and disagreeable things increase …  When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure, an ignoramus …  doesn’t cultivate it …  and disagreeable things increase …  Why is that?  Because that’s what it’s like for someone who doesn’t know.  When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain, a wise person, knowing this, truly understands:  ‘This is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.’  So instead of cultivating that practice, they avoid it.  When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things decrease, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things increase.  Why is that?  Because that’s what it’s like for someone who knows.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 47  The Inquirer  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, a mendicant who is an inquirer, unable to encompass another’s mind, should scrutinize the Realized One to understand whether he is a fully awakened Buddha or not.”  “Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”  “Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, a mendicant who is an inquirer, unable to encompass another’s mind, should scrutinize the Realized One for two things—things that can be seen and heard:  ‘Can anything corrupt be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’  Scrutinizing him they find that  nothing corrupt can be seen or heard in the Realized One.  They scrutinize further:  ‘Can anything mixed be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’  Scrutinizing him they find that  nothing mixed can be seen or heard in the Realized One.  They scrutinize further:  ‘Can anything clean be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’  Scrutinizing him they find that  clean things can be seen and heard in the Realized One.  They scrutinize further:  ‘Did the venerable attain this skillful state a long time ago, or just recently?’  Scrutinizing him they find that  the venerable attained this skillful state a long time ago, not just recently.  They scrutinize further:  ‘Are certain dangers found in that venerable mendicant who has achieved fame and renown?’  For, mendicants, so long as a mendicant has not achieved fame and renown, certain dangers are not found in them.  But when they achieve fame and renown, those dangers appear.  Scrutinizing him they find that  those dangers are not found in that venerable mendicant who has achieved fame and renown.  They scrutinize further:  ‘Is this venerable securely stilled or insecurely stilled?  Is the reason they don’t indulge in sensual pleasures that they’re free of greed because greed has ended?’  Scrutinizing him they find that  that venerable is securely stilled, not insecurely stilled.  The reason they don’t indulge in sensual pleasures is that they’re free of greed because greed has ended.  If others should ask that mendicant,  ‘But what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying this?’  Answering rightly, the mendicant should say,  ‘Because, whether that venerable is staying in a community or alone, some people there are in a good state or a sorry state, some instruct a group, and some are seen among pleasures of the flesh while others remain unsullied. Yet that venerable doesn’t look down on them for that.  Also, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  “I am securely stilled, not insecurely stilled. The reason I don’t indulge in sensual pleasures is that I’m free of greed because greed has ended.”’  Next, they should ask the Realized One himself about this,  ‘Can anything corrupt be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’  The Realized One would answer,  ‘Nothing corrupt can be seen or heard in the Realized One.’  ‘Can anything mixed be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’  The Realized One would answer,  ‘Nothing mixed can be seen or heard in the Realized One.’  ‘Can anything clean be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’  The Realized One would answer,  ‘Clean things can be seen and heard in the Realized One.  I am the scope and the range of that, but I am not determined by that.’  A disciple ought to approach a teacher who has such a doctrine in order to listen to the teaching.  The teacher explains Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides.  When they directly know a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how they were taught, the mendicant comes to a conclusion about the teachings. They have confidence in the teacher:  ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha! The teaching is well explained! The Saṅgha is practicing well!’  If others should ask that mendicant,  ‘But what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying this?’  Answering rightly, the mendicant should say,  ‘Reverends, I approached the Buddha to listen to the teaching.  He explained Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides.  When I directly knew a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how I was taught, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I had confidence in the Teacher:  “The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha! The teaching is well explained! The Saṅgha is practicing well!”’  When someone’s faith is settled, rooted, and planted in the Realized One in this manner",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 48  The Mendicants of Kosambī  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.  Now at that time the mendicants of Kosambī were fighting, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words.  They couldn’t persuade each other or be persuaded, nor could they convince each other or be convinced.  Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.  So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,  “Please, monk, in my name tell those mendicants that  the teacher summons them.”  “Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those monks and said,  “Venerables, the teacher summons you.”  “Yes, reverend,” those monks replied. They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them,  “Is it really true, mendicants, that you have been fighting, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words?  And that you can’t persuade each other or be persuaded, nor can you convince each other or be convinced?”  “Yes, sir,” they said.  “What do you think, mendicants?  When you’re fighting, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words, are you treating your spiritual companions with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private?”  “No, sir.”  “So it seems that when you’re arguing you are not treating each other with kindness.  So what then do you know and see, you futile men, that you behave in such a way?  This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”  Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:  “Mendicants, these six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.  What six?  Firstly, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with bodily kindness, both in public and in private.  This warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.  Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with verbal kindness …  Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with mental kindness …  Furthermore, a mendicant shares without reservation any material things they have gained by legitimate means, even the food placed in the alms-bowl, using them in common with their ethical spiritual companions …  Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the precepts shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. Those precepts are intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. …  Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the view shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. That view is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.  This warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.  These six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.  Of these six warm-hearted qualities, the chief is the view that is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering. It holds and binds everything together.  It’s like a bungalow. The roof-peak is the chief point, which holds and binds everything together.  In the same way, of these six warm-hearted qualities, the chief is the view that is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering. It holds and binds everything together.  And how does the view that is noble and emancipating lead one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering?  It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this,  ‘Is there anything that I’m overcome with internally and haven’t given up, because of which I might not accurately know and see?’  If a mendicant is overcome with sensual desire, it’s their mind that’s overcome.  If a mendicant is overcome with ill will,  dullness and drowsiness,  restlessness and remorse,  doubt,  pursuing speculation about this world,  pursuing speculation about the next world,  or fighting, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding others with barbed words, it’s their mind that’s overcome.  They understand,  ‘There is nothing that I’m overcome with internally and haven’t given up, because of which I might not accurately know and see.  My heart is properly disposed for awakening to the truths.’  This is the first knowledge they have achieved that is noble and transcendent, and is distinct from that of ordinary people.  Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,  ‘When I develop, cultivate, and make much of this view, do I personally gain serenity and quenching?’  They understand,  ‘When I develop, cultiv",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 49  On the Invitation of Divinity  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “This one time, mendicants, I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.  Now at that time Baka the Divinity had the following harmful misconception:  ‘This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is not liable to pass away. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’  Then I knew what Baka the Divinity was thinking.  As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, I vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared in that realm of divinity.  Baka saw me coming off in the distance  and said,  ‘Come, good fellow! Welcome, good fellow!  It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.  For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is not liable to pass away. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’  When he had spoken, I said to him,  ‘Oh lord, Baka the Divinity is lost in ignorance! Oh lord, Baka the Divinity is lost in ignorance!  Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and liable to pass away, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and not liable to pass away.  And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that  there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.  And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.’  Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of the retinue of Divinity and said this to me,  ‘Mendicant, mendicant! Don’t attack this one! Don’t attack this one! For this is the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.  There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who criticized and loathed earth, water, fire, air, creatures, gods, the Progenitor, and the Divinity.  When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were established in a lower realm.  There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who praised and approved earth, water, fire, air, creatures, gods, the Progenitor, and the Divinity.  When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were established in a higher realm.  So, mendicant, I tell you this:  please, good fellow, do exactly what the Divinity says. Don’t go beyond the word of the Divinity.  If you do, then you’ll end up like a person who, when approached by Lady Luck, would fend her off with a staff; or who, as they are falling over a cliff, would lose grip of the ground with their hands and feet.  Please, good fellow, do exactly what the Divinity says. Don’t go beyond the word of the Divinity.  Do you not see the assembly of the Divinity gathered here?’  And so Māra the Wicked presented the assembly of the Divinity to me.  When he had spoken, I said to Māra,  ‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,  “He does not know me.”  You are Māra the Wicked.  And the Divinity, the Divinity’s assembly, and the retinue of Divinity have all fallen into your hands; they’re under your sway.  And you think,  “Maybe this one, too, has fallen into my hands; maybe he’s under my sway!”  But I haven’t fallen into your hands; I’m not under your sway.’  When I had spoken, Baka the Divinity said to me,  ‘But, good fellow, what I say is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and not liable to pass away is in fact permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and not liable to pass away. And where I say there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn there is in fact  no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.  And when I say there’s no other escape beyond this there is in fact no other escape beyond this.  There have been ascetics and brahmins in the world before you, mendicant, whose deeds of fervent mortification lasted as long as your entire life.  When there was another escape beyond this they knew it, and when there was no other escape beyond this, they knew it.  So, mendicant, I tell you this:  you will never find another escape beyond this, and you will eventually get weary and frustrated.  If you attach to earth, you will lie close to me, in my domain, subject to my will, and expendable.  If you attach to water …  fire …  air …  creatures …  gods …  the Progenitor …  the Divinity, you will lie close to me, in my domain, s",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 50  The Condemnation of Māra  So I have heard.  At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile’s Bellow, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.  At that time Moggallāna was walking mindfully in the open air.  Now at that time Māra the Wicked had got inside Moggallāna’s belly.  Moggallāna thought,  “Why now is my belly so very heavy,  like I’ve just eaten a load of beans?”  Then he stepped down from the walking path, entered his dwelling, sat down on the seat spread out,  and investigated inside himself.  He saw that Māra the Wicked had got inside his belly.  So he said to Māra,  “Come out, Wicked One,  come out!  Do not harass the Realized One or his disciple.  Don’t create lasting harm and suffering for yourself!”  Then Māra thought,  “This ascetic doesn’t really know me or see me when he tells me to come out.  Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly, so how could a disciple?”  Then Moggallāna said to Māra,  “I know you even when you’re like this, Wicked One. Do not think,  ‘He doesn’t know me.’  You are Māra the Wicked.  And you think,  ‘This ascetic doesn’t really know me or see me when he tells me to come out.  Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly, so how could a disciple?’”  Then Māra thought,  “This ascetic really does know me and see me when he tells me to come out.”  Then Māra came up out of Moggallāna’s mouth and stood against the door.  Moggallāna saw him there  and said,  “I see you even there, Wicked One. Do not think,  ‘He doesn’t see me.’  That’s you, Wicked One, standing against the door.  Once upon a time, Wicked One, I was a Māra named Dūsī, and I had a sister named Kāḷī.  You were her son,  which made you my nephew.  At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world.  Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva.  Of all the disciples of the Buddha Kakusandha,  none were the equal of Venerable Vidhura in teaching Dhamma.  And that’s how he came to be known as Vidhura.  But when Venerable Sañjīva had gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he easily attained the cessation of perception and feeling.  Once upon a time, Sañjīva was sitting at the root of a certain tree having attained the cessation of perception and feeling.  Some cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him sitting there  and said,  ‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!  This ascetic passed away while seated.  We should cremate him.’  They collected grass, wood, and cow-dung, heaped it all on Sañjīva’s body, set it on fire, and left.  Then, when the night had passed, Sañjīva emerged from that attainment, shook out his robes, and, since it was morning, he robed up and entered the village for alms.  Those cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him wandering for alms  and said,  ‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!  This ascetic passed away while seated, and now he has come back to life!’  And that’s how he came to be known as Sañjīva.  Then it occurred to Māra Dūsī,  ‘I don’t know the course of rebirth of these ethical mendicants of good character.  Why don’t I take possession of these brahmins and householders and say,  “Come, all of you, abuse, attack, harass, and trouble the ethical mendicants of good character.  Hopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability.”’  And that’s exactly what he did.  Then those brahmins and householders abused, attacked, harassed, and troubled the ethical mendicants of good character:  ‘These shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, say, “We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!” Shoulders drooping, downcast, and dopey, they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.  They’re just like an owl on a branch, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse.  They’re just like a jackal on a river-bank, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a fish.  They’re just like a cat by an alley or a drain or a dustbin, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse.  They’re just like an unladen donkey by an alley or a drain or a dustbin, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates.  In the same way, these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, say, “We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!” Shoulders drooping, downcast, and dopey, they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.’  Most of the people who died at that time—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.  Then Kakusandha the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, addressed the mendicants:  ‘Mendicants, the brahmins and househol",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 51  With Kandaraka  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.  Then Pessa the elephant driver’s son and Kandaraka the wanderer went to see the Buddha. When they had approached, Pessa bowed and sat down to one side.  But the wanderer Kandaraka exchanged greetings with the Buddha and stood to one side.  He looked around the mendicant Saṅgha, who were so very silent, and said to the Buddha:  “It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!  How the mendicant Saṅgha has been led to practice properly by the worthy Gotama!  The perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly at best do so  like the worthy Gotama does in the present.”  “That’s so true, Kandaraka! That’s so true!  The perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly at best do so  like I do in the present.  For in this mendicant Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their heart’s goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.  And in this mendicant Saṅgha there are trainee mendicants who are consistently ethical, living consistently, alert, living alertly.  They meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.  What four?  It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.”  When he had spoken, Pessa said to the Buddha:  “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!  How well described by the Buddha are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation! They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.  For we white-clothed laypeople also from time to time meditate with our minds well established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.  We meditate observing an aspect of the body …  feelings …  mind …  principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.  It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!  How the Buddha knows what’s best for sentient beings, even though humans continue to be so shady, rotten, and tricky.  For human beings are shady, sir,  while beasts are obvious.  For I can drive an elephant in training,  and while going back and forth in Campā it’ll try all the tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints that it can.  But my bondservants, servants, and workers behave one way by body, another by speech, and their minds another.  It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!  How the Buddha knows what’s best for sentient beings, even though humans continue to be so shady, rotten, and tricky.  For human beings are shady, sir,  while beasts are obvious.”  “That’s so true, Pessa! That’s so true!  For human beings are shady,  while beasts are obvious.  Pessa, these four individuals are found in the world.  What four?  One individual mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.  One individual mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others.  One individual mortifies themselves and others, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.  One individual doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.  They live without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine.  Which one of these four individuals do you like the sound of?”  “Sir, I don’t like the sound of the first three individuals.  I only like the sound of the last individual, who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others.”  “But why don’t you like the sound of those three individuals?”  “Sir, the individual who mortifies themselves does so even though they want to be happy and recoil from pain.  That’s why I don’t like the sound of that individual.  The individual who mortifies others does so even though others want to be happy and recoil from pain.  That’s why I don’t like the sound of that individual.  The individual who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from pain.  That’s why I don’t like the sound of that individual.  The individual who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others—living without wishes, que",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 52  The Wealthy Citizen  So I have heard.  At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.  Now at that time the householder Dasama, a wealthy citizen, had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business.  He went to the Chicken Monastery, approached a certain mendicant, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, where is Venerable Ānanda now staying?  For I want to see him.”  “Householder, Venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.”  Then the householder Dasama, having concluded his business there, went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see Ānanda. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda:  “Honorable Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke?”  “There is, householder.”  “And what is that one thing?”  “Householder, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.  Then they reflect:  ‘Even this first absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’  They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’  Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.  If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.  This is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.  Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …  third absorption …  fourth absorption …  Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.  Then they reflect:  ‘Even this heart’s release by love is produced by choices and intentions.’  They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ …  Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …  rejoicing …  equanimity …  Furthermore, householder, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.  Then they reflect:  ‘Even this attainment of the dimension of infinite space is produced by choices and intentions.’  They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ …  Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …  Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.  Then they reflect:  ‘Even this attainment of the dimension of nothingness is produced by choices and intentions.’  They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’  Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.  If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.  This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.”  When he said this, the householder Dasama said to Venerable Ānanda,  “Honorable Ānanda, suppose a person was looking for the entrance to a treasure trove. And all at once they’d come across eleven entrances!  In the same way, I was searching for the door to freedom from death. And all at once I found eleven doors to freedom from death for cultivation.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 53  A Trainee  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.  Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any human at all.  Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:  “Sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any human at all.  May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it.  That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.”  The Buddha consented with silence.  Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha,  bowed, stood to one side,  and told him of their preparations, saying,  “Please, sir, come at your convenience.”  Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east.  The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.  The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.  The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he addressed Venerable Ānanda,  “Ānanda, speak about the practicing trainee to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu as you feel inspired.  My back is sore,  I’ll stretch it.”  “Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.  And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.  Then Ānanda addressed Mahānāma the Sakyan:  “Mahānāma, a noble disciple is accomplished in ethics, guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness. They have seven good qualities, and they get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.  And how is a noble disciple accomplished in ethics?  It’s when a noble disciple is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.  That’s how a noble disciple is ethical.  And how does a noble disciple guard the sense doors?  When a noble disciple sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.  If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.  When they hear a sound with their ears …  When they smell an odor with their nose …  When they taste a flavor with their tongue …  When they feel a touch with their body …  When they know an idea with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.  If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.  That’s how a noble disciple guards the sense doors.  And how does a noble disciple eat in moderation?  It’s when a noble disciple reflects rationally on the food that they eat:  ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’  That’s how a noble disciple eats in moderation.  And how is a noble disciple dedicated to wakefulness?  It’s when a noble disciple practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles.  In the first watch of the night, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation.  In the middle watch, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.  In the last watch, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles.  That’s how a noble disc",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 54  With Potaliya the Householder  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans, near the town of theirs named Āpaṇa.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.  He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.  Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.  Potaliya the householder also approached that forest grove while going for a walk. He was well dressed in sarong and cloak, with parasol and sandals. Having plunged deep into it, he went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and the Buddha said to him,  “There are seats, householder. Please sit if you wish.”  When he said this, Potaliya was angry and upset. Thinking, “The ascetic Gotama addresses me as ‘householder’!” he stayed silent.  For a second time …  and a third time the Buddha said to him,  “There are seats, householder. Please sit if you wish.”  When he said this, Potaliya was angry and upset. Thinking, “The ascetic Gotama addresses me as ‘householder’!” he said to the Buddha,  “Worthy Gotama, it is neither proper nor appropriate for you to address me as ‘householder’.”  “Well, householder, you have the features, attributes, and signs of a householder.”  “Mister Gotama, it’s because I have turned down all work and cut off all business.”  “Householder, in what way have you turned down all work and cut off all business?”  “Worthy Gotama, all the money, grain, gold, and silver I used to have has been handed over to my children as their inheritance. And in this matter I do not advise or reprimand them, but live with nothing more than food and clothes.  That’s how I have turned down all work and cut off all business.”  “The cutting off of business as you describe it is one thing, householder, but the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training is quite different.”  “But what, sir, is cutting off of business in the noble one’s training?  Sir, please teach me this.”  “Well then, householder, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” said Potaliya.  The Buddha said this:  “Householder, these eight things lead to the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training.  What eight?  Killing living creatures should be given up, relying on not killing living creatures.  Stealing should be given up, relying on not stealing.  Lying should be given up, relying on speaking the truth.  Divisive speech should be given up, relying on speech that isn’t divisive.  Greed and lust should be given up, relying on not being greedy and lustful.  Blaming and insulting should be given up, relying on not blaming and not insulting.  Anger and distress should be given up, relying on not being angry and distressed.  Arrogance should be given up, relying on not being arrogant.  These are the eight things—stated in brief without being analyzed in detail—that lead to the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training.”  “Sir, please teach me these eight things in detail out of sympathy.”  “Well then, householder, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” said Potaliya.  The Buddha said this:  “‘Killing living creatures should be given up, relying on not killing living creatures.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  It’s when a noble disciple reflects:  ‘I am practicing to give up and cut off the fetters that might cause me to kill living creatures.  But if I were to kill living creatures, because of that I would reprimand myself; sensible people, after examination, would criticize me; and when my body breaks up, after death, I could expect to be reborn in a bad place.  And killing living creatures is itself a fetter and a hindrance.  The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise because of killing living creatures do not occur in someone who does not kill living creatures.’  ‘Killing living creatures should be given up, relying on not killing living creatures.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘Stealing …  lying …  divisive speech …  greed and lust …  blaming and insulting …  anger and distress …  Arrogance should be given up, relying on not being arrogant.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  It’s when a noble disciple reflects:  ‘I am practicing to give up and cut off the fetters that might cause me to be arrogant.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 55  With Jīvaka  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca.  Then Jīvaka went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:  “Sir, I have heard this:  ‘They slaughter living creatures specially for the ascetic Gotama. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared on his behalf: this is a deed he caused.’  I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”  “Jīvaka, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.  In three cases I say that meat may not be eaten:  it’s seen, heard, or suspected.  These are three cases in which meat may not be eaten.  In three cases I say that meat may be eaten:  it’s not seen, heard, or suspected.  These are three cases in which meat may be eaten.  Take the case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village.  They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.  A householder or their child approaches and invites them for the next day’s meal.  The mendicant accepts if they want.  When the night has passed, they robe up in the morning, take their bowl and robe, and approach that householder’s home, where they sit on the seat spread out.  That householder or their child serves them with delicious almsfood.  It never occurs to them,  ‘It’s so good that this householder serves me with delicious almsfood!  I hope they serve me with such delicious almsfood in the future!’  They don’t think that.  They eat that almsfood untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape.  What do you think, Jīvaka?  At that time is that mendicant intending to hurt themselves, hurt others, or hurt both?”  “No, sir.”  “Aren’t they eating blameless food at that time?”  “Yes, sir.  Sir, I have heard that  The Divinity abides in love.  Now, I’ve seen the Buddha with my own eyes,  and it is the Buddha who truly abides in love.”  “Any greed, hate, or delusion that might give rise to ill will has been given up by the Realized One, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and is unable to arise in the future.  If that’s what you were referring to, I grant it.”  “That’s exactly what I was referring to.”  “Take the case, Jīvaka, of a mendicant living supported by a town or village.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 56  With Upāli  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.  At that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics.  Then the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī wandered for alms in Nāḷandā. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to Pāvārika’s mango grove. There he approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side. The Buddha said to him,  “There are seats, Tapassī. Please sit if you wish.”  When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī took a low seat and sat to one side.  The Buddha said to him,  “Tapassī, how many kinds of deed does the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan describe for performing bad deeds?”  “Reverend Gotama, the Jain Ñātika doesn’t usually speak in terms of ‘deeds’.  He usually speaks in terms of ‘rods’.”  “Then how many kinds of rod does the Jain Ñātika describe for performing bad deeds?”  “The Jain Ñātika describes three kinds of rod for performing bad deeds:  the physical rod, the verbal rod, and the mental rod.”  “But are these kinds of rod all distinct from each other?”  “Yes, each is quite distinct.”  “Of the three rods thus analyzed and differentiated, which rod does the Jain Ñātika describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds: the physical rod, the verbal rod, or the mental rod?”  “The Jain Ñātika describes the physical rod as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”  “Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”  “I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”  “Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”  “I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”  “Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”  “I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”  Thus the Buddha made Dīgha Tapassī stand by this point up to the third time.  When this was said, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Buddha,  “But Reverend Gotama, how many kinds of rod do you describe for performing bad deeds?”  “Tapassī, the Realized One doesn’t usually speak in terms of ‘rods’.  He usually speaks in terms of ‘deeds’.”  “Then how many kinds of deed do you describe for performing bad deeds?”  “I describe three kinds of deed for performing bad deeds:  physical deeds, verbal deeds, and mental deeds.”  “But are these kinds of deed all distinct from each other?”  “Yes, each is quite distinct.”  “Of the three deeds thus analyzed and differentiated, which deed do you describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds: physical deeds, verbal deeds, or mental deeds?”  “I describe mental deeds as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much physical deeds or verbal deeds.”  “Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?”  “I say mental deeds, Tapassī.”  “Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?”  “I say mental deeds, Tapassī.”  “Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?”  “I say mental deeds, Tapassī.”  Thus the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī made the Buddha stand by this point up to the third time, after which he got up from his seat and went to see the Jain Ñātika.  Now at that time the Jain Ñātika was sitting together with a large assembly of Bālaki laypeople headed by Upāli.  The Jain Ñātika saw Dīgha Tapassī coming off in the distance  and said to him,  “So, Tapassī, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”  “Just now, sir, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”  “But did you have some discussion with him?”  “I did.”  “And what kind of discussion did you have with him?”  Then Dīgha Tapassī informed the Jain Ñātika of all they had discussed.  When he had spoken, the Jain Ñātika said to him,  “Good, good, Tapassī!  Dīgha Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions.  For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the solid physical rod?  Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”  When he said this, the householder Upāli said to him,  “Good, sir! Well done, Dīgha Tapassī!  The Honorable Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions.  For how significant is the measly mental rod when compared with the solid physical rod?  Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.  I’d better go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine regarding this point.  If he stands by the position that he stated to Dīgha Tapassī, I’ll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would grab a fleecy sheep and drag it to and fro and round about!  Taking him on in debate, I’ll drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep lake, grab it by the corners, a",

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Haliddavasana.  Then Puṇṇa the Koliyan, a cow votary, and the naked ascetic Seniya, a dog votary, went to see the Buddha. Puṇṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side, while Seniya exchanged greetings and polite conversation with him before sitting down to one side curled up like a dog.  Puṇṇa said to the Buddha,  “Sir, this naked ascetic Seniya the dog votary does a hard thing: he eats food placed on the ground.  For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dog.  Where will he be reborn in his next life?”  “Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.”  For a second time …  and a third time, Puṇṇa said to the Buddha,  “Sir, this naked ascetic Seniya does a hard thing: he eats food placed on the ground.  For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dog.  Where will he be reborn in his next life?”  “Clearly, Puṇṇa, I’m not getting through to you when I say:  ‘Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’  Nevertheless, I will answer you.  Take someone who develops the dog observance fully and uninterruptedly. They develop a dog’s ethics, a dog’s mentality, and a dog’s behavior fully and uninterruptedly.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of dogs.  But if they have such a view: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ This is their wrong view.  An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm.  So if the dog observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of dogs, but if it fails it leads to hell.”  When he said this, Seniya cried and burst out in tears.  The Buddha said to Puṇṇa,  “This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said:  ‘Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’”  Seniya said, “Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said.  But, sir, for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a dog.  Sir, this Puṇṇa is a cow votary.  For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a cow.  Where will he be reborn in his next life?”  “Enough, Seniya, let it be. Don’t ask me that.”  For a second time …  and a third time Seniya said to the Buddha,  “Sir, this Puṇṇa is a cow votary.  For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a cow.  Where will he be reborn in his next life?”  “Clearly, Seniya, I’m not getting through to you when I say:  ‘Enough, Seniya, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’  Nevertheless, I will answer you.  Take someone who develops the cow observance fully and uninterruptedly. They develop a cow’s ethics, a cow’s mentality, and a cow’s behavior fully and uninterruptedly.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of cows.  But if they have such a view: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ This is their wrong view.  An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm.  So if the cow observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of cows, but if it fails it leads to hell.”  When he said this, Puṇṇa cried and burst out in tears.  The Buddha said to Seniya,  “This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said:  ‘Enough, Seniya, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’”  Puṇṇa said, “Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said.  But, sir, for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a cow.  I am quite confident that the Buddha  is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this cow observance, and the naked ascetic Seniya can give up that dog observance.”  “Well then, Puṇṇa, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” he replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Puṇṇa, I declare these four kinds of deeds, having realized them with my own insight.  What four?  There are dark deeds with dark results;  bright deeds with bright results;  dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results; and  neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds.  And what are dark deeds with dark results?  It’s when someone makes hurtful choices by way of body, speech, and mind.  Having made these choices, they’re reborn in a hurtful world,  where hurtful contacts strike them.  Touched by hurtful contacts, they experience hurtful feelings that are exclusively painful—like the beings in hell.  This is how a being is born from a being.  For your deeds determine your rebirth,  and when you’re reborn contacts strike you.  This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds.  These are called dark deeds with dark results.  And what are bright deeds with bright results?  It’s when someone makes pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind.  Having made these choice",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 58  With Prince Abhaya  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Then Prince Abhaya went up to the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Jain Ñātika said to him,  “Come, prince, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.  Then you will get a good reputation:  ‘Prince Abhaya refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’”  “But sir, how am I to do this?”  “Here, prince, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him:  ‘Sir, may the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?’  When he’s asked this, if he answers:  ‘He may, prince,’ say this to him,  ‘So what then, sir, is the difference between you and an ordinary person?  For even an ordinary person may utter speech that is disliked by others.’  But if he answers,  ‘He may not, prince,’ say this to him:  ‘So why then, sir, did you declare of Devadatta:  “Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable”?  Devadatta was angry and upset with what you said.’  When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.  He’ll be like a man with an iron cross stuck in his throat, unable to either spit it out or swallow it down.”  “Yes, sir,” replied Abhaya. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Jain Ñātika, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.  Then he looked up at the sun and thought,  “It’s too late to refute the Buddha’s doctrine today.  I shall refute his doctrine in my own home tomorrow.” He said to the Buddha,  “Sir, may the Buddha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with three other monks.”  The Buddha consented with silence.  Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Abhaya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.  Then when the night had passed, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Abhaya’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out.  Then Abhaya served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.  When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Abhaya took a low seat, sat to one side,  and said to him,  “Sir, may the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?”  “This matter is not categorical, prince.”  “Then the Jains have lost in this, sir.”  “But prince, why do you say that  the Jains have lost in this?”  Then Abhaya told the Buddha all that had happened.  Now at that time a little baby boy was sitting in Prince Abhaya’s lap.  Then the Buddha said to Abhaya,  “What do you think, prince?  If—because of your negligence or his nursemaid’s negligence—your boy were to put a stick or stone in his mouth, what would you do to him?”  “I’d try to take it out, sir.  If that didn’t work, I’d cradle his head with my left hand and take it out using a hooked finger of my right hand, even if it drew blood.  Why is that?  Because I have sympathy for the boy, sir.”  “In the same way, prince, the Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and pointless, and which is disliked by others.  The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and correct, but which is harmful and disliked by others.  The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true, correct, and beneficial, but which is disliked by others.  The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and pointless, but which is liked by others.  The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and correct, but which is harmful, even if it is liked by others.  The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true, correct, and beneficial, and which is liked by others.  Why is that?  Because the Realized One has sympathy for sentient beings.”  “Sir, there are clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics who come to see you with a question already planned.  Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer just strike you on the spot?”  “Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.  What do you think, prince?  Are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot?”  “I am, sir.”  “What do you think, prince?  When they come to you and ask:  ‘What’s the name of this chariot part?’  Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer appear to you on the spot?”  “Sir, I’m well-known as a charioteer skilled in a chariot’s parts.  All the major and minor parts are well-known to me.  The answer just appears to me on the spot.”  “In the same way, when clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics come to see me with a question already planned, the answer",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 59  The Many Kinds of Feeling  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga went up to Venerable Udāyī, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, how many feelings has the Buddha spoken of?”  “Chamberlain, the Buddha has spoken of three feelings:  pleasant, painful, and neutral.  The Buddha has spoken of these three feelings.”  When he said this, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,  “Sir, Udāyī, the Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings.  He’s spoken of two feelings:  pleasant and painful.  The Buddha said that neutral feeling is included as a peaceful and subtle kind of pleasure.”  For a second time, Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga,  “The Buddha hasn’t spoken of two feelings,  he’s spoken of three.”  For a second time, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,  “The Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings,  he’s spoken of two.”  And for a third time, Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga,  “The Buddha hasn’t spoken of two feelings,  he’s spoken of three.”  And for a third time, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,  “The Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings,  he’s spoken of two.”  But neither was able to persuade the other.  Venerable Ānanda heard this discussion between Udāyī and Pañcakaṅga.  Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,  and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.  When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,  “Ānanda, the explanation by the mendicant Udāyī, which the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga didn’t agree with, was quite correct. But the explanation by Pañcakaṅga, which Udāyī didn’t agree with, was also quite correct.  In one explanation I’ve spoken of two feelings. In another explanation I’ve spoken of three feelings, or five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, or a hundred and eight feelings.  I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways.  This being so, you can expect that those who don’t concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will fight, quarrel, and dispute, continually wounding each other with barbed words.  I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways.  This being so, you can expect that those who do concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.  There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.  What five?  Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  Sounds known by the ear …  Smells known by the nose …  Tastes known by the tongue …  Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.  The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.  There are those who might say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience. But I don’t grant them that.  Why is that?  Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that.  And what is that pleasure?  It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.  This is a pleasure that is finer than that.  There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience. But I don’t grant them that.  Why is that?  Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that.  And what is that pleasure?  It’s when, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. …  There is another pleasure that is finer than that.  And what is that pleasure?  It’s when, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ …  There is another pleasure that is finer than that.  And what is that pleasure?  It’s when, with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. …  There is another pleasure that is finer than that.  And what is that pleasure?  It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. …  There is another pleasure that is finer than that.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 60  Unfailing  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā.  The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. The Buddha said to them:  “So, householders, is there any teacher you’re happy with, in whom you have acquired grounded faith?”  “No, sir.”  “Since you haven’t found a teacher you’re happy with, you should undertake and implement this unfailing teaching.  For when the unfailing teaching is undertaken, it will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.  And what is the unfailing teaching?  There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:  ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’  And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this.  They say:  ‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’  What do you think, householders?  Don’t these doctrines directly contradict each other?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that  there’s no meaning in giving, etc.  You can expect that they will shun good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and undertake and implement bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.  Why is that?  Because those ascetics and brahmins don’t see that unskillful qualities are full of drawbacks, sordidness, and corruption, or that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation.  Moreover, since there actually is another world, their view that there is no other world is wrong view.  Since there actually is another world, their thought that there is no other world is wrong thought.  Since there actually is another world, their speech that there is no other world is wrong speech.  Since there actually is another world, in saying that there is no other world they contradict those perfected ones who know the other world.  Since there actually is another world, in persuading another that there is no other world they are persuading them to accept an untrue teaching.  And on account of that they glorify themselves and put others down.  So they give up their former ethical conduct and are established in unethical conduct.  And that is how these many bad, unskillful qualities come to be with wrong view as condition—wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, contradicting the noble ones, persuading others to accept untrue teachings, and glorifying oneself and putting others down.  A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:  ‘If there is no other world, when this individual person’s body breaks up they will keep themselves safe.  And if there is another world, when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.  But let us grant that those who say that there is no other world are correct.  Regardless, that individual is still criticized by sensible people in this very life as being an immoral individual of wrong view, a nihilist.’  But if there really is another world, they hold a losing hand on both counts.  For they are criticized by sensible people in this very life, and when their body breaks up, after de",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 61  Advice to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Now at that time Venerable Rāhula was staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.  Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ambalaṭṭhika to see Venerable Rāhula.  Rāhula saw the Buddha coming off in the distance.  He spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,  and washed his feet.  Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.  Then the Buddha, leaving a little water in the pot, addressed Rāhula,  “Rāhula, do you see this little bit of water left in the pot?”  “Yes, sir.”  “That’s how little of the ascetic’s nature is left in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”  Then the Buddha, discarding what little water was left in the pot, said to Rāhula,  “Do you see this little bit of water that was discarded?”  “Yes, sir.”  “That’s how the ascetic’s nature is discarded in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”  Then the Buddha, turning the pot upside down, said to Rāhula,  “Do you see how this pot is turned upside down?”  “Yes, sir.”  “That’s how the ascetic’s nature is turned upside down in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”  Then the Buddha, turning the pot right side up, said to Rāhula,  “Do you see how this pot is vacant and hollow?”  “Yes, sir.”  “That’s how vacant and hollow the ascetic’s nature is in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.  Suppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariot-poles, able to draw a heavy load, pedigree and battle-hardened. In battle it uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, but it still protects its trunk.  So its rider thinks:  ‘This royal bull elephant still protects its trunk.  It has not yet given its life.’  But when that royal bull elephant … in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk, its rider thinks:  ‘This royal bull elephant … in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk.  It has given its life.  Now there is nothing that royal bull elephant would not do.’  In the same way, when someone is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no bad deed they would not do, I say.  So you should train like this: ‘I will not tell a lie, even for a joke.’  What do you think, Rāhula?  What is the purpose of a mirror?”  “It’s for checking your reflection, sir.”  “In the same way, deeds of body, speech, and mind should be done only after repeated checking.  When you want to act with the body, you should check on that same deed:  ‘Does this act with the body that I want to do lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both?  Is it unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result?’  If, while checking in this way, you know:  ‘This act with the body that I want to do leads to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.  It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ To the best of your ability, Rāhula, you should not do such a deed.  But if, while checking in this way, you know:  ‘This act with the body that I want to do doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.  It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should do such a deed.  While you are acting with the body, you should check on that same act:  ‘Does this act with the body that I am doing lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both?  Is it unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result?’  If, while checking in this way, you know:  ‘This act with the body that I am doing leads to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.  It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should desist from such a deed.  But if, while checking in this way, you know:  ‘This act with the body that I am doing doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.  It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should continue doing such a deed.  After you have acted with the body, you should check on that same act:  ‘Does this act with the body that I have done lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both?  Is it unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result?’  If, while checking in this way, you know:  ‘This act with the body that I have done leads to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.  It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should confess, reveal, and clarify such a deed to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.  And Venerable Rāhula also robed up and followed behind the Buddha.  Then the Buddha looked back at Rāhula and said,  “Rāhula, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’”  “Only form, Blessed One? Only form, Holy One?”  “Form, Rāhula, as well as feeling and perception and choices and consciousness.”  Then Rāhula thought, “Who would go to the village for alms today after being advised directly by the Buddha?” Turning back, he sat down cross-legged at the root of a certain tree, setting his body straight, and establishing mindfulness in his presence.  Venerable Sāriputta saw him sitting there,  and addressed him,  “Rāhula, develop mindfulness of breathing.  When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial.”  Then in the late afternoon, Rāhula came out of retreat, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:  “Sir, how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?”  “Rāhula, the interior earth element is anything internal, personal, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated. This includes:  head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces; or anything else internal, personal, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated.  This is called the interior earth element.  The interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth element.  This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’  When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the earth element, detaching the mind from the earth element.  And what is the water element?  The water element may be interior or exterior.  And what is the interior water element?  Anything internal, personal, that’s water, watery, and appropriated. This includes:  bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine; or anything else internal, personal, that’s water, watery, and appropriated.  This is called the interior water element.  The interior water element and the exterior water element are just the water element.  This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’  When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the water element, detaching the mind from the water element.  And what is the fire element?  The fire element may be interior or exterior.  And what is the interior fire element?  Anything internal, personal, that’s fire, fiery, and appropriated.

This is called the interior fire element.  The interior fire element and the exterior fire element are just the fire element.

This includes:  the ear canals, nostrils, and mouth; and the space for swallowing what is eaten and drunk, the space where it stays, and the space for excreting it from the nether regions; or anything else internal, personal, that’s space, spacious, and appropriated.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 63  The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then as Venerable Māluṅkyaputta was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:  “There are several convictions that the Buddha has left undeclared; he has set them aside and turned them down.  For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are one and the same, or the soul is one thing, the body another; after death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.  The Buddha does not explain these points to me.  I don’t endorse that, and do not accept it.  I’ll go to him and ask him about this.  If he gives me a straight answer on any of these points,  I will lead the spiritual life under him.  If he does not explain these points to me,  I shall disavow the training and return to a lesser life.”  Then in the late afternoon, Māluṅkyaputta came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his thoughts. He then continued:  “If the Buddha knows  that the cosmos is eternal, please tell me.  If you know  that the cosmos is not eternal, tell me.  If you don’t know  whether the cosmos is eternal or not, then it is straightforward to simply say:  ‘I neither know nor see.’  If you know  that the cosmos is finite,  or infinite;  that the soul and the body are one and the same,  or is the soul one thing, the body another;  that after death, a realized one still exists,  or no longer exists,  or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists, please tell me.  If you don’t know  any of these things, then it is straightforward to simply say:  ‘I neither know nor see.’”  “What, Māluṅkyaputta, did I ever say to you:  ‘Come, Māluṅkyaputta, lead the spiritual life under me, and I will declare these things to you’?”  “No, sir.”  “Or did you ever say to me:  ‘Sir, I will lead the spiritual life under the Buddha, and the Buddha will declare these things to me’?”  “No, sir.”  “So it seems that I did not say to you:  ‘Come, Māluṅkyaputta, lead the spiritual life under me, and I will declare these things to you.’  And you never said to me:  ‘Sir, I will lead the spiritual life under the Buddha, and the Buddha will declare these things to me.’  In that case, you futile man, who are you and what do you want to disavow?  Suppose someone were to say this:  ‘I will not lead the spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to me  that the cosmos is eternal, or that the cosmos is not eternal …  or that after death a realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists.’  That would still remain undeclared by the Realized One, and meanwhile that individual would die.  Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison.  His friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a surgeon to treat him.  But the man would say:  ‘I won’t extract this arrow as long as I don’t know whether the man who wounded me was an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial.’  He’d say:  ‘I won’t extract this arrow as long as I don’t know the following things about the man who wounded me: his name and clan;  whether he’s tall, short, or medium;  whether his skin is black, brown, or dingy;  and what village, town, or city he comes from.  I won’t extract this arrow as long as I don’t know whether the bow that wounded me was straight or recurved;  whether the bow-string is made of swallow-wort fibre, sunn hemp fibre, sinew, sanseveria fibre, or spurge fibre;  whether the shaft is made from a bush or a plantation tree;  whether the shaft was fitted with feathers from a vulture, a heron, a hawk, a peacock, or a stork;  whether the shaft was bound with sinews of a cow, a buffalo, a black lion, or an ape;  and whether the arrowhead was spiked, razor-tipped, barbed, made of iron or a calf’s tooth, or lancet-shaped.’  That man would still not have learned these things, and meanwhile they’d die.  In the same way, suppose someone was to say:  ‘I will not lead the spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to me  that the cosmos is eternal, or that the cosmos is not eternal …  or that after death a realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists.’  That would still remain undeclared by the Realized One, and meanwhile that individual would die.  It’s not true that if there were the view ‘the cosmos is eternal’ there would be the living of the spiritual life.  It’s not true that if there were the view ‘the cosmos is not eternal’ there would be the living of the spiritual life.  When there is the view that the cosmos is eternal or that the cosmos is not eternal, there is rebirth, there is old age, there is death, and there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 64  The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, do you remember the five lower fetters taught by me?”  When he said this, Venerable Māluṅkyaputta said to him,  “Sir, I remember them.”  “But how do you remember them?”  “I remember the lower fetters taught by the Buddha as follows: substantialist view,  doubt,  misapprehension of precepts and observances,  sensual desire,  and ill will.  That’s how I remember the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha.”  “Who on earth do you remember being taught the five lower fetters in that way?  Wouldn’t the wanderers of other religions fault you using the simile of the infant?  For a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘substantial reality’, so how could substantialist view possibly arise in them?  Yet the underlying tendency to substantialist view still lies within them.  A little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘teachings’, so how could doubt about the teachings possibly arise in them?  Yet the underlying tendency to doubt still lies within them.  A little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘precepts’, so how could misapprehension of precepts and observances possibly arise in them?  Yet the underlying tendency to misapprehension of precepts and observances still lies within them.  A little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘sensual pleasures’, so how could desire for sensual pleasures possibly arise in them?  Yet the underlying tendency to sensual desire still lies within them.  A little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘sentient beings’, so how could ill will for sentient beings possibly arise in them?  Yet the underlying tendency to ill will still lies within them.  Wouldn’t the wanderers of other religions fault you using the simile of the infant?”  When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,  “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!  May the Buddha teach the five lower fetters. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”  “Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Ānanda, take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.  Their heart is overcome and mired in substantialist view,  and they don’t truly understand the escape from substantialist view that has arisen.  That substantialist view is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.  Their heart is overcome and mired in doubt,  and they don’t truly understand the escape from doubt that has arisen.  That doubt is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.  Their heart is overcome and mired in misapprehension of precepts and observances,  and they don’t truly understand the escape from misapprehension of precepts and observances that has arisen.  That misapprehension of precepts and observances is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.  Their heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire,  and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.  That sensual desire is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.  Their heart is overcome and mired in ill will,  and they don’t truly understand the escape from ill will that has arisen.  That ill will is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.  But a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons. Their heart is not overcome and mired in substantialist view,  and they truly understand the escape from substantialist view that has arisen.  That substantialist view, along with any underlying tendency to it, is given up in them.  Their heart is not overcome and mired in doubt,  and they truly understand the escape from doubt that has arisen.  That doubt, along with any underlying tendency to it, is given up in them.  Their heart is not overcome and mired in misapprehension of precepts and observances,  and they truly understand the escape from misapprehension of precepts and observances that has arisen.  That misapprehension of precepts and observances, along with any underlying tendency to it, is given up in them.  Their heart is not overcome and mired in sensual desire,  and they truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 65  With Bhaddāli  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I eat my food in one sitting per day.  Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  You too should eat your food in one sitting per day.  Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”  When he said this, Venerable Bhaddāli said to the Buddha,  “Sir, I’m not going to try to eat my food in one sitting per day.  For when eating once a day I might feel remorse and regret.”  “Well then, Bhaddāli, eat one part of the meal in the place where you’re invited, and bring the rest back to eat.  Eating this way, too, you will sustain yourself.”  “Sir, I’m not going to try to eat that way, either.  For when eating that way I might also feel remorse and regret.”  Then, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, Bhaddāli announced he would not try to keep it.  Then for the whole of that three months Bhaddāli would not see the Buddha face to face, as happens when someone doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.  At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that  when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.  Then Bhaddāli went up to those mendicants, and exchanged greetings with them.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The mendicants said to Bhaddāli,  “Reverend Bhaddāli, this robe is being made for the Buddha.  When it’s finished and the three months of the rains residence have passed the Buddha will set out wandering.  Come on, Bhaddāli, learn your lesson. Don’t make it hard for yourself later on.”  “Yes, reverends,” Bhaddāli replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “I made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, I announced I would not try to keep it.  Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”  “Indeed, Bhaddāli, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, you announced you would not try to keep it.  And you didn’t realize this situation:  ‘The Buddha is staying in Sāvatthī, and he’ll know me  as the mendicant named Bhaddāli who doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.’  And you didn’t realize this situation:  ‘Several monks have commenced the rains retreat in Sāvatthī …  several nuns have commenced the rains retreat in Sāvatthī …  several laymen reside in Sāvatthī …  several laywomen reside in Sāvatthī, and they’ll know me  as the mendicant named Bhaddāli who doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions. …  Several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions have commenced the rains retreat in Sāvatthī, and they’ll know me  as the mendicant named Bhaddāli, one of the senior disciples of Gotama, who doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.’  You also didn’t realize this situation.”  “I made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, I announced I would not try to keep it.  Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”  “Indeed, Bhaddāli, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, you announced you would not try to keep it.  What do you think, Bhaddāli?  Suppose I was to say this to a mendicant who is freed both ways:  ‘Please, mendicant, be a bridge for me to cross over the mud.’ Would they cross over themselves, or struggle to get out of it, or just say no?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, Bhaddāli?  Suppose I was to say the same thing to a mendicant who is freed by wisdom,  or a direct witness,  or attained to view,  or freed by faith,  or a follower of teachings,  or a follower by faith:  ‘Please, mendicant, be a bridge for me to cross over the mud.’ Would they cross over themselves, or struggle to get out of it, or just say no?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, Bhaddāli?  At that time were you freed both ways, freed by wisdom, a direct witness, attained to view, freed by faith, a follower of teachings, or a follower by faith?”  “No, sir.”  “Weren’t you vacuous, hollow, and mistaken?”  “Yes, sir.  I made a mistake …  Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”  “Indeed, ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 66  The Simile of the Quail  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans, near the town of theirs named Āpaṇa.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.  He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.  Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.  Venerable Udāyī also robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.  He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to that forest grove for the day’s meditation.  Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.  Then as Venerable Udāyī was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:  “The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!  He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!”  Then in the late afternoon, Udāyī came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:  “Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:  ‘The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!  He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!’  For we used to eat at dusk, at daybreak, and at the wrong time of day.  But then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants, saying,  ‘Please, mendicants, give up that meal at the wrong time of day.’  At that, sir, we became sad and upset,  ‘But these faithful householders give us delicious fresh and cooked foods at the wrong time of day. And the Blessed One tells us to give it up! The Holy One tells us to let it go!’  But when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha, and our sense of conscience and prudence, we gave up that meal at the wrong time of day.  Then we ate at dusk and daybreak.  But then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants, saying,  ‘Please, mendicants, give up that meal at the wrong time of night.’  At that, sir, we became sad and upset,  ‘But that’s considered the more delicious of the two meals. And the Blessed One tells us to give it up! The Holy One tells us to let it go!’  Once it so happened that a certain person got some soup during the day. He said,  ‘Come, let’s set this aside; we’ll enjoy it together this evening.’  Nearly all meals are prepared at night, only a few in the day.  But when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha, and our sense of conscience and prudence, we gave up that meal at the wrong time of night.  In the past, mendicants went wandering for alms in the dark of the night. They walked into a swamp, or fell into a sewer, or collided with a thorn bush, or collided with a sleeping cow, or encountered youths escaping a crime or on their way to commit one, or were invited by a lady to commit a lewd act.  Once it so happened that I was wandering for alms in the dark of the night.  A woman washing a pot saw me by a flash of lightning.  Startled, she cried out,  ‘Woe is me! It’s a damn goblin!’  When she said this, I said to her,  ‘Sister, I am no goblin.  I’m a mendicant waiting for alms.’  ‘Die, mendicant’s father! Die, mendicant’s mother!  Better to have your belly sliced open with a sharp meat cleaver than to wander for alms in the dark of night for the sake of your belly!’  Recollecting that, I thought,  ‘The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!  He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!’”  “This is exactly what happens when some futile people are told by me to give something up. They say,  ‘What, such a trivial, trifling thing as this? This ascetic is much too strict!’  They don’t give it up, and they nurse bitterness towards me;  and for the mendicants who want to train, that becomes a strong, firm, stout bond, a tie that has not rotted, and a heavy yoke.  Suppose a quail was tied with a vine, and was waiting there to be injured, caged, or killed.  Would it be right to say that,  for that quail, that vine is weak, feeble, rotten, and insubstantial?”  “No, sir.  For that quail, that vine is a strong, firm, stout bond, a tie that has not rotted, and a heavy yoke.”  “In the same way, when some futile people are told by me to give something up, they say,  ‘What, such a trivial, trifling thing as this?

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 67  At Cātumā  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Cātumā in a myrobalan grove.  Now at that time five hundred mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna arrived at Cātumā to see the Buddha.  And the visiting mendicants, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a colossal racket.  Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,  “Ānanda, who’s making that colossal racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”  And Ānanda told him what had happened.  “Well then, Ānanda, in my name tell those mendicants that  the teacher summons them.”  “Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. He went to those mendicants and said,  “Venerables, the teacher summons you.”  “Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:  “Mendicants, what’s with that colossal racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”  And they told him what had happened.  “Go away, mendicants, I dismiss you. You are not to stay in my presence.”  “Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They got up from their seats, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. They set their lodgings in order and left, taking their bowls and robes.  Now at that time the Sakyans of Cātumā were sitting together at the town hall on some business.  Seeing those mendicants coming off in the distance,  they went up to them and said,  “Hello venerables, where are you going?”  “Good sirs, the mendicant Saṅgha has been dismissed by the Buddha.”  “Well then, venerables, sit here for an hour. Hopefully we’ll be able to restore the Buddha’s confidence.”  “Yes, good sirs,” replied the mendicants.  Then the Sakyans of Cātumā went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:  “May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!  May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!  May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!  There are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training.  If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.  If young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart.  In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.  If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart.  In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.  May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!  May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!  May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!”  Then the divinity Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha.  He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:  “May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!  May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!  May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!  There are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.  If young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart. …  If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart.  In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.  May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!  May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!  May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!”  The Sakyans of Cātumā and the divinity Sahampati were able to restore the Buddha’s confidence with the similes of the seedlings and the calf.  Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants,  “Get up, reverends, and pick up your bowls and robes.  The Buddha’s confidence has been restored by the Sakyans of Cātumā and the divinity Sahampati with the similes of the seedlings and the calf.”  “Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. Then they rose from their seats and, taking their bowls and robes, went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,  “Sāriputta, what did you think when the mendicant Saṅgha was dismissed by me?”  “Sir, I thought this:  ‘The Buddha has dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha.  Now he will remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life, and so will we.’”  “Hold on, Sāriputta, hold on! Don’t you ever think such ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 68  At Naḷakapāna  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near Naḷakapāna in the grove of flame-of-the-forest trees.  Now at that time several very well-known gentlemen had gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha’s name— The venerables Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, Koṇḍañña, Revata, Ānanda, and other very well-known gentlemen.  Now at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the mendicant Saṅgha.  Then the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about those gentlemen:  “Mendicants, those gentlemen who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness in my name—I trust they’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”  When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.  For a second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question.  For a third time, the mendicants kept silent.  Then it occurred to the Buddha,  “Why don’t I question just those gentlemen?”  Then the Buddha said to Venerable Anuruddha,  “Anuruddha and friends, I hope you’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”  “Indeed, sir, we are satisfied with the spiritual life.”  “Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!  It’s appropriate for gentlemen like yourselves, who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, to be satisfied with the spiritual life.  Since you’re blessed with youth, in the prime of life, with pristine black hair, you could have enjoyed sensual pleasures; yet you have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.  But you didn’t go forth to escape a summons by a king or a summons for a bandit, or because you were in debt or in fear, or in order to make a living.  Rather, didn’t you go forth thinking: ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.  Hopefully I can make an end to this entire mass of suffering’?”  “Yes, sir.”  “But, Anuruddha and friends, when a gentleman has gone forth like this, what should he do?  Take someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is still occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, discontent, and sloth.  That’s someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.  Take someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is not occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, discontent, and sloth.  That’s someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.  Is this what you think of me?  ‘The Realized One has not given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.  That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and dispels some things.’”  “No sir, we don’t think of you that way.  We think of you this way:  ‘The Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.  That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and dispels some things.’”  “Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!  The Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.  Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,  in the same way, the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the future.  That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and dispels some things.  What do you think, Anuruddha and friends?  What advantage does the Realized One see in declaring the rebirth of his disciples who have passed away:  ‘This one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there’?”  “Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”  “The Realized One does not declare such things for the sake of fawning or flattering people, nor for the benefit of possessions, honor, or popularity, nor thinking, ‘So let people know about me!’  Rather, there are gentlemen of faith who are full of sublime joy and gladness.  When they hear that, they apply their minds to that end.  That ",

Now at that time a wilderness mendicant of boorish behavior named Gulissāni had come down to the midst of the Saṅgha on some business.  There Venerable Sāriputta spoke to the mendicants about Gulissāni:  “Reverends, a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should have respect and reverence for his spiritual companions.  If he doesn’t, there’ll be some who say:  ‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he has no respect and reverence for his spiritual companions?’  That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should have respect and reverence for his spiritual companions.  A wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should be careful where he sits, thinking:  ‘I shall sit so that I don’t intrude on the senior monks and I don’t block the junior monks from a seat.’  If he doesn’t, there’ll be some who say:  ‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he’s not careful where he sits?’  That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should be careful where he sits.  A wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should know even the supplementary regulations.  If he doesn’t, there’ll be some who say:  ‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he doesn’t even know the supplementary regulations?’  That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should know even the supplementary regulations.  A wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t enter the village too early or return too late in the day.  If he does so, there’ll be some who say:  ‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he enters the village too early or returns too late in the day?’  That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t enter the village too early or return too late in the day.  A wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t visit families before or after the meal.  If he does so, there’ll be some who say:  ‘This wilderness venerable, staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, must be used to wandering about at the wrong time, since he behaves like this when he’s come to the Saṅgha.’  That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t visit families before or after the meal.  A wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t be restless and fickle.  If he is, there’ll be some who say:  ‘This wilderness venerable, staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, must be used to being restless and fickle, since he behaves like this when he’s come to the Saṅgha.’  That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t be restless and fickle.  A wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t be scurrilous and loose-tongued.  If he is, there’ll be some who say:  ‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he’s scurrilous and loose-tongued?’  That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t be scurrilous and loose-tongued.  A wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should be easy to admonish, with good friends.  If he’s hard to admonish, with bad friends, there’ll be some who say:  ‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he’s hard to admonish, with bad friends?’  That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should be easy to admonish, with good friends.  A wilderness monk should guard the sense doors.  If he doesn’t, there’ll be some who say:  ‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he doesn’t guard the sense doors?’  That’s why a wilderness monk should guard the sense doors.  A wilderness monk should eat in moderation.  If he doesn’t, there’ll be some who say:  ‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he eats too much?’  That’s why a wilderness monk should eat in moderation.  A wilderness monk should be committed to wakefulness.  If he isn’t, there’ll be some who say:  ‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he’s not committed to wakefulness?’  That’s why a wilderness monk should be committed to wakefulness.  A wilderness monk should be energetic.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 70  At Kīṭāgiri  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kāsis together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:  “Mendicants, I abstain from eating at night.  Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  You too should abstain from eating at night.  Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the land of the Kāsis, arrived at a town of the Kāsis named Kīṭāgiri,  and stayed there.  Now at that time the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at Kīṭāgiri.  Then several mendicants went up to them and said,  “Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha.  Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  You too should abstain from eating at night.  Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”  When they said this, the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka said to them,  “Reverends, we eat at dusk, at daybreak, and at the wrong time of day.  Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  Why should we give up what is apparent in the present to chase after what takes effect over time?  We shall eat at dusk, at daybreak, and at the wrong time of day.”  Since those mendicants were unable to persuade the mendicants who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka, they approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.  So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,  “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicants who follow Assaji and Punabbasuka that  the teacher summons them.”  “Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those mendicants and said,  “Venerables, the teacher summons you.”  “Yes, reverend,” those mendicants replied. They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.  The Buddha said to them, “Is it really true, mendicants, that several mendicants went to you and said:  ‘Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha.  Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  You too should abstain from eating at night.  Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’  When they said this, did you really say to them:  ‘Reverends, we eat at dusk, at daybreak, and at the wrong time of day.  Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  Why should we give up what is apparent in the present to chase after what takes effect over time?  We shall eat at dusk, at daybreak, and at the wrong time of day.’”  “Yes, sir.”  “Mendicants, have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma like this: no matter what this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—their unskillful qualities decline and their skillful qualities grow?”  “No, sir.”  “Haven’t you known me to teach the Dhamma like this: ‘When someone feels this kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow. When someone feels this kind of painful feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of painful feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow. When someone feels this kind of neutral feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of neutral feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow’?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Good, mendicants!  Now, suppose I hadn’t known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom:  ‘When someone feels this kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline.’  Not knowing this, would it be appropriate for me to say: ‘You should give up this kind of pleasant feeling’?”  “No, sir.”  “But I have known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom:  ‘When someone feels this kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline.’ Since this is so, that’s why I say: ‘You should give up this kind of pleasant feeling.’  Now, suppose I hadn’t known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom:  ‘When someone feels that kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow.’  Not knowing this, would it be appropriate for me to say: ‘You should enter and remain in that kind of pleasant feeling’?”  “No, sir.”  “But I have known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom:  ‘When someone feels that kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualiti",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 71  To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.  Now at that time the wanderer Vacchagotta was residing in the Single Lotus Monastery of the wanderers.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.  Then it occurred to him,  “It’s too early to wander for alms in Vesālī.  Why don’t I visit the wanderer Vacchagotta at the Single Lotus Monastery?”  So that’s what he did.  Vacchagotta saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,  and said to him,  “Let the Blessed One come, sir!  Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!  It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.  Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,  while Vacchagotta took a low seat and sat to one side.  Then Vacchagotta said to the Buddha:  “Sir, I have heard this:  ‘The ascetic Gotama claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:  “Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.”’  I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”  “Vaccha, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.”  “So how should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”  “‘The ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges.’ Answering like this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.  For, Vaccha, whenever I want, I recollect my many kinds of past lives.  That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollect my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.  And whenever I want, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds.  And I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.  ‘The ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges.’ Answering like this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.”  When he said this, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Buddha,  “Worthy Gotama, are there any laypeople who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, make an end of suffering when the body breaks up?”  “No, Vaccha.”  “But are there any laypeople who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, go to heaven when the body breaks up?”  “There’s not just one hundred laypeople, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, go to heaven when the body breaks up.”  “Worthy Gotama, are there any Ājīvaka ascetics who make an end of suffering when the body breaks up?”  “No, Vaccha.”  “But are there any Ājīvaka ascetics who go to heaven when the body breaks up?”  “Vaccha, when I recollect the past ninety-one eons, I can’t find any Ājīvaka ascetics who have gone to heaven, except one;  and he taught the efficacy of deeds and action.”  “In that case, worthy Gotama, that sectarian fold is empty even of the chance to go to heaven.”  “Yes, Vaccha, that sectarian fold is empty even of the chance to go to heaven.”  That is what the Buddha said.  Satisfied, the wanderer Vacchagotta approved what the Buddha said. ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 72  With Vacchagotta on Fire  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:  “Worthy Gotama, is this your view: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”  “That’s not my view, Vaccha.”  “Then is this your view: ‘The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”  “That’s not my view, Vaccha.”  “Then is this your view: ‘The cosmos is finite. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”  “That’s not my view, Vaccha.”  “Then is this your view: ‘The cosmos is infinite. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”  “That’s not my view, Vaccha.”  “Then is this your view: ‘The soul and the body are one and the same. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”  “That’s not my view, Vaccha.”  “Then is this your view: ‘The soul is one thing, the body another. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”  “That’s not my view, Vaccha.”  “Then is this your view: ‘A realized one still exists after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”  “That’s not my view, Vaccha.”  “Then is this your view: ‘A realized one no longer exists after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”  “That’s not my view, Vaccha.”  “Then is this your view: ‘A realized one both still exists and no longer exists after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”  “That’s not my view, Vaccha.”  “Then is this your view: ‘A realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”  “That’s not my view, Vaccha.”  “Worthy Gotama, when asked these ten questions, you say: ‘That’s not my view.’  Seeing what drawback do you avoid all these convictions?”  “Each of these ten convictions is the thicket of views, the desert of views, the twist of views, the dodge of views, the fetter of views. They’re beset with suffering, distress, anguish, and fever. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.  Seeing this drawback I avoid all these convictions.”  “But does the worthy Gotama have any convictions at all?”  “A realized one has done away with convictions.  For a realized one has seen:  ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.  Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.  Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.  Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.  Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’  That’s why a Realized One is freed with the ending, fading away, cessation, giving up, and letting go of all conceiving, all churning, and all I-making, mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit, I say.”  “But worthy Gotama, when a mendicant’s mind is freed like this, where are they reborn?”  “‘They’re reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”  “Well then, are they not reborn?”  “‘They’re not reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”  “Well then, are they both reborn and not reborn?”  “‘They’re both reborn and not reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”  “Well then, are they neither reborn nor not reborn?”  “‘They’re neither reborn nor not reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”  “Worthy Gotama, when asked all these questions, you say: ‘It doesn’t apply.’  I fail to understand this point, worthy Gotama; I’ve fallen into confusion.  And I’ve now lost even the degree of clarity I had from previous discussions with the worthy Gotama.”  “No wonder you don’t understand, Vaccha, no wonder you’re confused.  For this principle is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.  It’s hard for you to understand, since you have a different view, creed, and belief, unless you dedicate yourself to practice with the guidance of tradition.  Well then, Vaccha, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.  What do you think, Vaccha?  Suppose a fire was burning in front of you. Would you know:  ‘This fire is burning in front of me’?”  “Yes, I would, worthy Gotama.”  “But Vaccha, suppose they were to ask you:  ‘This fire burning in front of you: what does it depend on to burn?’ How would you answer?”  “I would answer like this:  ‘This fire burning in front of me burns in dependence on grass and logs as fuel.’”  “Suppose that fire burning in front of you was extinguished. Would you know:  ‘This fire in front of me is quenched’?”  “Yes, I would, worthy Gotama.”  “But Vaccha, suppose they were to ask you:  ‘This fire in front of you that is quenched: in what direction did it go— east, south, west, or north?’ H",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 73  The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,  “For a long time I have had discussions with the worthy Gotama.  Please teach me in brief what is skillful and what is unskillful.”  “Vaccha, I can teach you what is skillful and what is unskillful in brief or in detail.  Still, let me do so in brief.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” Vaccha replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Greed is unskillful, contentment is skillful.  Hate is unskillful, love is skillful.  Delusion is unskillful, understanding is skillful.  So there are these three unskillful things and three that are skillful.  Killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; covetousness, ill will, and wrong view: these things are unskillful.  Refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; refraining from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, kind-heartedness, and right view: these things are skillful.  So there are these ten unskillful things and ten that are skillful.  When a mendicant has given up craving so it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future, that mendicant is perfected. They’ve ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their heart’s goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.”  “Leaving aside the worthy Gotama,  is there even a single monk disciple of the worthy Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements?”  “There are not just one hundred such monks who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”  “Leaving aside the worthy Gotama and the monks,  is there even a single nun disciple of the worthy Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements?”  “There are not just one hundred such nuns who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”  “Leaving aside the worthy Gotama, the monks, and the nuns,  is there even a single layman disciple of Mister Gotama—white-clothed and chaste—who, with the ending of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously, to be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world?”  “There are not just one hundred such chaste laymen who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”  “Leaving aside Mister Gotama, the monks, the nuns, and the chaste laymen,  is there even a single layman disciple of the worthy Gotama—white-clothed, enjoying sensual pleasures, following instructions, and responding to advice—who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and lives self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instruction?”  “There are not just one hundred such laymen enjoying sensual pleasures who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”  “Leaving aside Mister Gotama, the monks, the nuns, the chaste laymen, and the laymen enjoying sensual pleasures,  is there even a single laywoman disciple of Mister Gotama—white-clothed and chaste—who, with the ending of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously, to be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world?”  “There are not just one hundred such chaste laywomen who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”  “Leaving aside Mister Gotama, the monks, the nuns, the chaste laymen, the laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, and the chaste laywomen,  is there even a single laywoman disciple of the worthy Gotama—white-clothed, enjoying sensual pleasures, following instructions, and responding to advice—who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and lives self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instruction?”  “There are not just one hundred such laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”  “If the worthy Gotama was the only one to succeed in this teaching, not any monks,  then this spiritual path would be incomplete in that respect.  But because both the worthy Gotama and monks have succeeded in this teaching,  this spiritual path is complete in that respect.  If the worthy Gotam",

Then the wanderer Dīghanakha went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side and said to the Buddha,  “Worthy Gotama, this is my doctrine and view:  ‘Nothing is acceptable to me.’”  “This view of yours, Aggivessana— is that acceptable to you?”  “If I were to accept this view, worthy Gotama, it would make no difference, it would make no difference!”  “Well, Aggivessana, there are many more in the world who say,  ‘It would make no difference! It would make no difference!’  But they don’t give up that view, and they grasp another view.  And there are a scant few in the world who say,  ‘It would make no difference! It would make no difference!’  And they give up that view by not grasping another view.  There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:  ‘Everything is acceptable to me.’  There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:  ‘Nothing is acceptable to me.’  There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:  ‘Some things are acceptable to me and some things are not.’  Regarding this, the view of the ascetics and brahmins to whom everything is acceptable  is close to greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.  The view of the ascetics and brahmins to whom nothing is acceptable  is far from greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.”  When he said this, the wanderer Dīghanakha said to the Buddha,  “Worthy Gotama commends my conviction! He recommends my conviction!”  “Now, regarding the ascetics and brahmins to whom  some things are acceptable and some things are not.  Their view of what is acceptable is close to greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.  Their view of what is not acceptable is far from greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.  When it comes to the view of the ascetics and brahmins to whom  everything is acceptable,  a sensible person reflects like this:  ‘I have the view that  everything is acceptable.  Suppose I were to obstinately stick to this view and insist,  “This is the only truth, anything else is futile.”  Then I’d argue with two individuals— an ascetic or brahmin to whom nothing is acceptable,  and an ascetic or brahmin to whom some things are acceptable and some things are not.  And when there’s arguing, there’s dispute; when there’s dispute there’s distress; and when there’s distress there’s harm.’  So, considering in themselves the potential for argument, dispute, distress, and harm, they give up that view by not grasping another view.  That’s how those views are given up and let go.

It’s made up of the four principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. You should see it as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as gloom, as an affliction, as alien, as breaking apart, as empty, as not-self.  Doing so, you’ll give up desire, affection, and subservience to the body.  There are these three feelings:  pleasant, painful, and neutral.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 75  With Māgaṇḍiya  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma, on a grass mat in the fire chamber of a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kammāsadamma for alms.  He wandered for alms in Kammāsadamma. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.  Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.  Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber.  He saw the grass mat spread out there  and asked the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan,  “Worthy Bhāradvāja, who has this grass mat been spread out for? It looks like an ascetic’s bed.”  “There is the ascetic Gotama, a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  This bed has been spread for that worthy Gotama.”  “Well, it’s a sad sight, worthy Bhāradvāja,  a very sad sight indeed,  to see a bed for the worthy Gotama, that baby-killer!”  “Be careful what you say, Māgaṇḍiya,  be careful what you say.  Many astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics are devoted to the worthy Gotama. They’ve been guided by him in the noble system, the skillful teaching.”  “Even if I was to see the worthy Gotama face to face, worthy Bhāradvāja, I would say to his face:  ‘The ascetic Gotama is a baby-killer.’  Why is that?  For so it came to me while sleeping.”  “If you don’t mind, I’ll tell the ascetic Gotama about this.”  “Don’t worry, worthy Bhāradvāja. You may tell him exactly what I’ve said.”  With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan and the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya.  Coming out of retreat, he went to the brahmin’s fire chamber and sat on the grass mat.  Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,  “Bhāradvāja, did you have a discussion with the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya about this grass mat?”  When he said this, the brahmin, shocked and awestruck, said to the Buddha,  “I wanted to mention this very thing to the worthy Gotama,  but you brought it up before I had a chance.”  But this conversation between the Buddha and the brahmin was left unfinished.  Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber. He went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and the Buddha said to him:  “Māgaṇḍiya, the eye likes sights, it loves them and enjoys them.  That’s been tamed, guarded, protected and restrained by the Realized One, and he teaches Dhamma for its restraint.  Is that what you were referring to when you called me  a baby-killer?”  “That’s exactly what I was referring to.  Why is that?  For so it came to me while sleeping.”  “The ear likes sounds …  The nose likes smells …  The tongue likes tastes …  The body likes touches …  The mind likes ideas, it loves them and enjoys them.  That’s been tamed, guarded, protected and restrained by the Realized One, and he teaches Dhamma for its restraint.  Is that what you were referring to when you called me  a baby-killer?”  “That’s exactly what I was referring to.  Why is that?  For so it came to me while sleeping.”  “What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?  Take someone who used to amuse themselves with sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Some time later—having truly understood the origin, disappearance, gratification, drawback, and escape of sights, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sights—they would live rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside.  What would you have to say to them, Māgaṇḍiya?”  “Nothing, worthy Gotama.”  “What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?  Take someone who used to amuse themselves with sounds known by the ear …  smells known by the nose …  tastes known by the tongue …  touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  Some time later—having truly understood the origin, disappearance, gratification, drawback, and escape of touches, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for touches—they would live rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 76  With Sandaka  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.  Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was residing at the cave of the wavy leaf fig tree together with a large assembly of around five hundred wanderers.  Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants:  “Come, reverends, let’s go to the Devakata Pool to see the cave.”  “Yes, reverend,” they replied.  Then Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Devakata Pool.  Now at that time, Sandaka and the large assembly of wanderers were sitting together making an uproar, a colossal racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as  talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.  Sandaka saw Ānanda coming off in the distance,  and hushed his own assembly,  “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.  The ascetic Ānanda, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming.  He is included among the disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Kosambī.  Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.  Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”  Then those wanderers fell silent.  Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the wanderer Sandaka,  who said to him,  “Come, worthy Ānanda! Welcome, worthy Ānanda!  It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.  Please sit down, this seat is ready.”  Ānanda sat down on the seat spread out,  while Sandaka took a low seat and sat to one side.  Ānanda said to Sandaka,  “Sandaka, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  “Worthy Ānanda, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.  It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.  It’d be great if the worthy Ānanda himself would give a Dhamma talk explaining his own tradition.”  “Well then, Sandaka, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied Sandaka.  Venerable Ānanda said this:  “Sandaka, these things have been explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: four ways that negate the spiritual life, and four kinds of unreliable spiritual life. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice them, they wouldn’t succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.”  “But worthy Ānanda, what are the four ways that negate the spiritual life, and the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life?”  “Sandaka, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:  ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.  This person is made up of the four principal states. When they die, the earth in their body progresses and proceeds to the substance of earth. The water in their body progresses and proceeds to the substance of water. The fire in their body progresses and proceeds to the substance of fire. The air in their body progresses and proceeds to the substance of air. The faculties are transferred to space.  Four men with a bier carry away the corpse.  Their footprints show the way to the cremation ground.  The bones become bleached.  Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes.  Giving is a doctrine of morons.  When anyone affirms a positive teaching it’s just hollow, false nonsense.  Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and they don’t exist after death.’  A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:  ‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.  If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it  have attained exactly the same level. Yet I’m not one who says that both of us are annihilated and destroyed when our body breaks up, and we don’t exist after death.  But it’s superfluous for this teacher to go nude, bald, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard. For I’m living at home with my children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and currency. Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.  What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher?  This negates th",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 77  The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground.  They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.  Then it occurred to him,  “It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.  Why don’t I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground?”  So the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers.  Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a colossal racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as  talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.  Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,  and hushed his own assembly,  “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.  Here comes the ascetic Gotama.  The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.  Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”  Then those wanderers fell silent.  Then the Buddha approached Sakuludāyī,  who said to him,  “Let the Blessed One come, sir!  Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!  It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.  Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,  while Sakuludāyī took a low seat and sat to one side.  The Buddha said to him,  “Udāyī, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  “Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.  It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.  Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions were sitting together at the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them:  ‘The people of Aṅga and Magadha are so fortunate, so very fortunate!  For there are these ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and tutor a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. And they have come down for the rainy season residence at Rājagaha.  They include Pūraṇa Kassapa,  the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla,  Ajita of the hair blanket,  Pakudha Kaccāyana,  Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta,  and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan.  This ascetic Gotama also leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people.  And he too has come down for the rains residence at Rājagaha.  Which of these ascetics and brahmins is honored, respected, revered, and venerated by their disciples? And how do their disciples, honoring and respecting them, remain loyal?’  Some of them said:  ‘This Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people.  But he’s not honored, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples. And his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.  Once it so happened that he was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.  Then one of his disciples made a noise,  “My good fellows, don’t ask Pūraṇa Kassapa about that.  He doesn’t know that.  I know it. Ask me about it,  and I’ll answer you.”  Once it so happened that Pūraṇa Kassapa didn’t get his way, though he called out with raised arms,  “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.  They’re not asking you, they’re asking me!  I’ll answer you!”  Indeed, many of his disciples have left him after refuting his doctrine:  “You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”  That’s how Pūraṇa Kassapa is not honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by his disciples. On the contrary, his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.  Rather, he’s reviled, and rightly so.’  Others said:  ’this bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla …  Ajita of the hair blanket …  Pakudha Kaccāyana …  Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta …  The Jain ascetic of the Ñāti",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 78  With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time the wanderer Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta was residing together with around five hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for philosophical debates, hedged by pale-moon ebony trees.  Then the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha.  It occurred to him,  “It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha,  as he’s in retreat.  And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants,  as they’re in retreat.  Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Uggāhamāna?”  So that’s what he did.  Now at that time, Uggāhamāna was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a colossal racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as  talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.  Uggāhamāna saw Pañcakaṅga coming off in the distance,  and hushed his own assembly,  “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.  Here comes Pañcakaṅga, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.  He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing in Sāvatthī.  Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.  Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”  Then those wanderers fell silent.  Then Pañcakaṅga approached Uggāhamāna, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Uggāhamāna said to him:  “Householder, when an individual person has four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.  What four?  It’s when they do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood.  When an individual possesses these four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic.”  Then Pañcakaṅga neither approved nor rejected the wanderer Uggāhamāna’s statement.  He got up from his seat, thinking,  “I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”  Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,  and informed the Buddha of all that had been discussed.  When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,  “Chamberlain, if what Uggāhamāna says is true, a little baby boy is an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.  For a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘a body’, so how could they possibly do a bad deed with their body, aside from just wriggling?  And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘speech’, so how could they possibly speak bad words, aside from just crying?  And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘thought’, so how could they possibly think bad thoughts, aside from just whimpering?  And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘livelihood’, so how could they possibly earn a living by bad livelihood, aside from their mother’s breast?  If what Uggāhamāna says is true, a little baby boy is an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.  When an individual person has four qualities I describe them, not as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment—but as having achieved the same level as a little baby.  What four?  It’s when they do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood.  When an individual possesses these four qualities I describe them, not as an invincible ascetic, but as having achieved the same level as a little baby.  When an individual person has ten qualities, chamberlain, I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.  The following things must be understood, I say. ‘These are unskillful behaviors.’  ‘Unskillful behaviors stem from this.’  ‘Here unskillful behaviors cease without anything left over.’  ‘Someone practicing like this is practicing for the cessation of unskillful behaviors.’  ‘These are skillful behaviors.’  ‘Skillful behaviors stem from this.’  ‘Here skillful behaviors cease without anything left over.’  ‘Someone practicing like this is practicing for the cessation of skillful behaviors.’  ‘These are unskillful thoughts.’  ‘Unskillful thoughts stem from this.’  ‘H",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 79  The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyī was residing together with a large assembly of wanderers in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.  Then it occurred to him,  “It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.  Why don’t I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground?”  Then the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers.  Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a colossal racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as  talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.  Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,  and hushed his own assembly,  “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.  Here comes the ascetic Gotama.  The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.  Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”  Then those wanderers fell silent.  Then the Buddha approached Sakuludāyī,  who said to him,  “Let the Blessed One come, sir!  Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!  It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.  Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,  while Sakuludāyī took a low seat and sat to one side.  The Buddha said to him,  “Udāyī, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  “Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.  It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.  When I don’t come to the assembly, they sit and engage in all kinds of low talk.  But when I have come to the assembly, they sit gazing up at my face alone, thinking,  ‘Whatever the ascetic Udāyī teaches, we shall listen to it.’  But when the Buddha has come to the assembly, both myself and the assembly sit gazing up at your face, thinking,  ‘Whatever the Buddha teaches, we shall listen to it.’”  “Well then, Udāyī, suggest something for me to talk about.”  “Sir, a few days ago someone was claiming to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: ‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’  When I asked them a question about the first beginning, they dodged the issue, distracted the discussion with irrelevant points, and displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness.  That reminded me of the Buddha:  ‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so skilled in such matters.’”  “But Udāyī, who was it that made such a claim and behaved in such a way?”  “It was the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan, sir.”  “Udāyī, someone who can recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details, might ask me a question about the first beginning, or I might ask them a question about the first beginning.  And they might satisfy me with their answer, or I might satisfy them with my answer.  Someone who, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds might ask me a question about the final end, or I might ask them a question about the final end.  And they might satisfy me with their answer, or I might satisfy them with my answer.  Nevertheless, Udāyī, leave aside the first beginning and the final end.  I shall teach you the Dhamma:  ‘When this exists, this comes to be; due to the arising of this, this arises.  When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.’”  “Well sir, I can’t even recall with features and details what I’ve undergone in this incarnation.  How should I possibly recollect my many kinds of past lives with features and details, like the Buddha?  For I can’t even see a mud-goblin right now.  How should I possibly, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn, like the Buddha?  But then the Buddha told me,  ‘Nevertheless, Udāyī, leave aside the first beginning and the final end.  I shall teach you the Dhamma:  “When this exists, this comes to be; due to the arising of this, this arises.  When this doesn’t exist, this doesn’t come to be; due to the cessation of this, this ceases.”’ But that is even more unclear to me.  Perhaps I might satisfy the Buddha by answering a question about my own tradition.”  “But Ud",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 80  With Vekhanasa  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then the wanderer Vekhanasa went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side,  and expressed this heartfelt sentiment:  “This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.”  “But Kaccāna, why do you say:  ‘This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.’  What is that ultimate splendor?”  “Worthy Gotama, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”  “But what is that ultimate splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer?”  “Worthy Gotama, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”  “Kaccāna, you could draw this out for a long time.  You say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.  Suppose a man was to say,  ‘Whoever the finest lady in the land is, it is her that I want, her I desire!’  They’d say to him,  ‘Worthy man, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether she’s an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial?’  Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’  They’d say to him,  ‘Mister, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know her name or clan? Whether she’s tall or short or medium? Whether her skin is black, brown, or dingy? What village, town, or city she comes from?’  Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’  They’d say to him,  ‘Worthy man, do you desire someone who you’ve never even known or seen?’  Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’  What do you think, Kaccāna?  This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?”  “Clearly that’s the case, worthy Gotama.”  “In the same way, you say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.”  “Mister Gotama, suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally lustrous, eight-faceted, well-worked. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate. Such is the splendor of the self that is free of disease after death.”  “What do you think, Kaccāna?  Which of these two has a finer splendor: such a beryl gem, or a firefly in the dark of night?”  “A firefly in the dark of night.”  “What do you think, Kaccāna?  Which of these two has a finer splendor: a firefly in the dark of night, or an oil lamp in the dark of night?”  “An oil lamp in the dark of night.”  “What do you think, Kaccāna?  Which of these two has a finer splendor: an oil lamp in the dark of night, or a great mass of fire in the dark of night?”  “A great mass of fire in the dark of night.”  “What do you think, Kaccāna?  Which of these two has a finer splendor: a great mass of fire in the dark of night, or the Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn?”  “The Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn.”  “What do you think, Kaccāna?  Which of these two has a finer splendor: the Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn, or the full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath?”  “The full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath.”  “What do you think, Kaccāna?  Which of these two has a finer splendor: the full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath, or the sun at midday in the clear and cloudless heavens in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn?”  “The sun at midday in the clear and cloudless heavens in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn.”  “Beyond this, Kaccāna, I know very many gods on whom the luminosity of the sun and moon makes no impression.  Nevertheless, I do not say:  ‘The splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’  But of the splendor inferior to a firefly you say, ‘This is the ultimate splendor.’ And you don’t describe that splendor.  Kaccāna, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.  What five?  Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  Sounds known by the ear …  Smells known by the nose …  Tastes known by the tongue …  Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.  The pleasure and happiness that arises from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.  ‘From the senses comes sensual pleasure. Beyond sensual pleasure is the pleasure that surmounts the sensual, which is said to be the best of these.’”  When he said this, Vekhanasa said to the Buddha,  “It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!  How well said this was by the worthy Gotama!  ‘From the senses comes sensual pleasure. Beyond sensual pleasure is the pleasure that sur",

Then the Buddha left the road, and at a certain spot he smiled.  Then Venerable Ānanda thought,  “What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?  Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”  So Ānanda arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,  “What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?  Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”  “Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga. It was successful and prosperous, populous, full of humans.  And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by Vebhaliṅga.  It was here, in fact, that he had his monastery,  where he advised the mendicant Saṅgha while seated.”  Then Ānanda spread out his outer robe folded in four and said to the Buddha,  “Well then, sir, may the Blessed One sit here!  Then this piece of land will have been occupied by two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.”  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out.  When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:  “Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga. It was successful and prosperous, populous, full of humans.  And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by Vebhaliṅga.  It was here, in fact, that he had his monastery,  where he advised the mendicant Saṅgha while seated.  The Buddha Kassapa had as chief supporter in Vebhaliṅga a potter named Ghaṭīkāra.  Ghaṭīkāra had a dear friend named Jotipāla, a student.  Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,  ‘Come, dear Jotipāla, let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’  When he said this, Jotipāla said to him,  ‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.  What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’  For a second time …  and a third time, Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,  ‘Come, dear Jotipāla, let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’  For a third time, Jotipāla said to him,  ‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.  What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’  ‘Well then, dear Jotipāla, let’s take some bathing cleanser and go to the river to bathe.’  ‘Yes, dear,’ replied Jotipāla.  So that’s what they did.  Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,  ‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.  Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’  When he said this, Jotipāla said to him,  ‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.  What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’  For a second time …  and a third time, Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,  ‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.

For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’  For a third time, Jotipāla said to him,  ‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.  What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’  Then Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the skirt-hem and said,  ‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.  Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’  So Jotipāla undid his skirt-hem and said to Ghaṭīkāra,  ‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.  What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’  Then Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the hair of his freshly-washed head and said,  ‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.  Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’  Then Jotipāla thought,  ‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing,  how this potter Ghaṭīkāra, though of lowly birth, should presume to grab me by the hair of my freshly-washed head!  This must be no ordinary matter.’  He said to Ghaṭīkāra,  ‘You’d even milk it to this extent, dear Ghaṭīkāra?’  ‘I even milk it to this extent, dear Jotipāla.  For that is how holy I deem it to see that Blessed One.’  ‘Well then, dear Ghaṭīkāra, release me, we shall go.’  Then Ghaṭīkāra the potter and Jotipāla the student went to the Buddha Kassapa. Ghaṭīkāra bowed and sat down to one side, but Jotipāla exchanged greetings with the Buddha and sat down to one side.  Ghaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa,  ‘Sir, this is the student Jotipāla, my dear friend.  Please teach him the Dhamma.’  Then the Buddha Kassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Ghaṭīkāra and Jotipāla with a Dhamma talk.  Then they got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha Kassapa, keeping him on their right, ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 82  With Raṭṭhapāla  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kurus together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kurus named Thullakoṭṭhika.  The brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Thullakoṭṭhika, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Then the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.  When they were seated, the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.  Now at that time a gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhika, was sitting in the assembly.  He thought,  “As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.  Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”  Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.  Soon after they left, Raṭṭhapāla went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, as I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.  I wish to shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.  Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?  May the Buddha please give me the going forth!”  “But, Raṭṭhapāla, do you have your parents’ permission?”  “No, sir.”  “Raṭṭhapāla, Buddhas don’t give the going forth to the child of parents who haven’t given their permission.”  “I’ll make sure, sir, to get my parents’ permission.”  Then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha. Then he went to his parents and said,  “Mum and dad, as I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.  I wish to shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.  Please give me permission to go forth.”  When he said this, Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him,  “But, dear Raṭṭhapāla, you’re our only child. You’re dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.  You know nothing of suffering.  Even when you die we will lose you against our wishes.  So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”  For a second time,  and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla asked his parents for permission, but got the same reply.  Then Raṭṭhapāla thought,  “My parents don’t allow me to go forth.” He laid down right there on the bare ground, saying,  “I’ll either die right here or go forth.”  And he refused to eat, up to the seventh meal.  Then Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him,  “Dear Raṭṭhapāla, you’re our only child. You’re dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.  You know nothing of suffering.  When you die we will lose you against our wishes.  So how can we allow you to go forth from lay life to homelessness while you’re still living?  Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Eat, drink, and amuse yourself.  While enjoying sensual pleasures, delight in making merit.  We don’t allow you to go forth.  When you die we will lose you against our wishes.  So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”  When they said this, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.  For a second time,  and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla’s parents made the same request.  And for a third time, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent. Raṭṭhapāla’s parents then went to see his friends. They told them of the situation and asked for their help.  Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to him and said,  “Our friend Raṭṭhapāla, you are your parents’ only child. You’re dear to them and they love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.

He justly treated brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.  And he observed the sabbath on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.  Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Maghadeva addressed his barber,  ‘My dear barber, when you see grey hairs growing on my head, please tell me.’  ‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the barber.  When many thousand years had passed, the barber saw grey hairs growing on the king’s head.  He said to the king,  ‘The messengers of the gods have shown themselves to you. Grey hairs can be seen growing on your head.’  ‘Well then, my dear barber, carefully pull them out with tweezers and place them in my cupped hands.’  ‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the barber, and he did as the king said.  The king gave the barber a prize village, then summoned the crown prince and said,  ‘Dear prince, the messengers of the gods have shown themselves to me.  Grey hairs can be seen growing on my head.  I have enjoyed human pleasures.  Now it is time to seek heavenly pleasures.  Come, dear prince, rule the realm.  I shall shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.  For dear prince, you too will one day see grey hairs growing on your head. When this happens, after giving a prize village to the barber and carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, you should shave off your hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.  Keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final man.  When a pair of men are living, the one who breaks such good practice is their final man.  Therefore I say to you,  “Keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final man.”’  And so, after giving a prize village to the barber and carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, King Maghadeva shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness here in this mango grove.  He meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.  He meditated spreading a heart full of compassion …  rejoicing …  equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.  For 84,000 years King Maghadeva played games as a child, for 84,000 years he acted as viceroy, for 84,000 years he ruled the realm, and for 84,000 years he led the spiritual life after going forth here in this mango grove.  And having developed the four divine meditations, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.  Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Maghadeva’s son addressed his barber,  ‘My dear barber, when you see grey hairs growing on my head, please tell me.’  And all unfolded as in the case of his father.  And having developed the four divine meditations, when his body broke up, after death, Maghadeva’s son was reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.  And a lineage of 84,000 kings, sons of sons of King Maghadeva, shaved off their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness here in this mango grove.  They meditated spreading a heart full of love …  compassion …  rejoicing …  equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 84  At Madhurā  So I have heard.  At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā, in the Nut Grass Grove.  King Avantiputta of Madhurā heard,  “It seems the ascetic Kaccāna is staying near Madhurā, in the Nut Grass Grove.  He has this good reputation:  ‘He is astute, competent, clever, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  And then King Avantiputta had the finest carriages harnessed. He mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Madhurā to see Mahākaccāna.  He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Mahākaccāna on foot. They exchanged greetings, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, the king sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna:  “Worthy Kaccāna, the brahmins say:  ‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.  Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.  Only brahmins are purified, not others.  Only brahmins are the true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’  What does the worthy Kaccāna have to say about this?”  “Great king, that’s just hearsay in the world.  And here’s a way to understand that it’s just hearsay in the world.  What do you think, great king?  Suppose an aristocrat prospers in money, grain, silver, or gold. Wouldn’t there be aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials who would get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely?”  “There would, worthy Kaccāna.”  “What do you think, great king?  Suppose a brahmin …  a peasant …  a menial prospers in money, grain, silver, or gold. Wouldn’t there be menials, aristocrats, brahmins, and peasants who would get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely?”  “There would, worthy Kaccāna.”  “What do you think, great king?  If this is so, are the four classes equal or not?  Or how do you see this?”  “Certainly, worthy Kaccāna, in this case these four classes are equal.  I can’t see any difference between them.”  “And here’s another way to understand that the claims of the brahmins are just hearsay in the world.  What do you think, great king?  Take an aristocrat who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct; uses speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and is covetous, malicious, and has wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, would they be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell, or not?  Or how do you see this?”  “Such an aristocrat would be reborn in a bad place.  That’s what I think, but I’ve also heard it from the perfected ones.”  “Good, good, great king!  It’s good that you think so, and it’s good that you’ve heard it from the perfected ones.  What do you think, great king?  Take a brahmin …  a peasant …  a menial who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct; uses speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and is covetous, malicious, and has wrong view.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 85  With Prince Bodhi  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile’s Bellow, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.  Now at that time a new stilt longhouse named Pink Lotus had recently been constructed for Prince Bodhi. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any human at all.  Then Prince Bodhi addressed the student Sañjikāputta,  “Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  And then ask him whether he  might accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” Sañjikāputta replied. He did as Prince Bodhi asked, and  the Buddha consented with silence.  Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sañjikāputta got up from his seat, went to Prince Bodhi, and said,  “I gave your message to the worthy Gotama,  and he accepted.”  And when the night had passed Prince Bodhi had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. He also had the Pink Lotus longhouse spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase. Then he said to Sañjikāputta,  “Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha, and announce the time, saying,  ‘Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.’”  “Yes, worthy sir,” Sañjikāputta replied, and he did as he was asked.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Prince Bodhi’s home.  Now at that time Prince Bodhi was standing outside the gates waiting for the Buddha.  Seeing the Buddha coming off in the distance,  he went out to greet him. After bowing and inviting the Buddha to go first, he approached the Pink Lotus longhouse.  But the Buddha stopped by the last step of the staircase.  Then Prince Bodhi said to him,  “Sir, let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth! Let the Holy One ascend on the cloth!  It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”  But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.  For a second time …  and a third time, Prince Bodhi said to him,  “Sir, let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth! Let the Holy One ascend on the cloth!  It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”  Then the Buddha glanced at Venerable Ānanda.  So Ānanda said to Prince Bodhi,  “Fold up the cloth, Prince.  The Buddha will not step upon white cloth.  The Realized One has sympathy for future generations.”  So Prince Bodhi had the cloth folded up and the seats spread out upstairs in the longhouse.  Then the Buddha ascended the longhouse and sat on the seats spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.  Then Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.  When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Prince Bodhi took a low seat, sat to one side,  and said to him,  “Sir, this is what I think:  ‘Pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’”  “Prince, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought:  ‘Pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’  Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.  Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,  ‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’  Āḷāra Kālāma replied,  ‘Stay, venerable.  This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’  I quickly memorized that teaching.  As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.  Then it occurred to me,  ‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”  Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’  So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,  ‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’  When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.  Then it occurred to me,  ‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,  energy,  mindfulness,  immersion,  and wisdom; I too have these things.  Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’  I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.  So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,  ‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 86  With Aṅgulimāla  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time in the realm of King Pasenadi of Kosala there was a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He was violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.  He laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.  He was constantly murdering humans, and he wore their fingers as a necklace.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.  Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, he walked down the road that led to Aṅgulimāla.  The cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and travelers saw him on the road,  and said to him,  “Don’t take this road, ascetic.  On this road there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.  He has laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.  He is constantly murdering humans, and he wears their fingers as a necklace.  People travel along this road only after banding closely together in groups of ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty.  Still they meet their end by Aṅgulimāla’s hand.”  But when they said this, the Buddha went on in silence.  For a second time …  and a third time, they urged the Buddha to turn back.  But when they said this, the Buddha went on in silence.  The bandit Aṅgulimāla saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,  and thought,  “Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!  People travel along this road only after banding closely together in groups of ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty.  Still they meet their end by my hand.  But still this ascetic comes along alone and unaccompanied, like a conqueror.  Why don’t I take his life?”  Then Aṅgulimāla donned his sword and shield, fastened his bow and arrows, and followed behind the Buddha.  But the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Aṅgulimāla could not catch up with him no matter how hard he tried, even though the Buddha kept walking at a normal speed.  Then Aṅgulimāla thought,  “Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!  Previously, even when I’ve chased a speeding elephant, horse, chariot or deer, I’ve always caught up with them.  But I can’t catch up with this ascetic no matter how hard I try, even though he’s walking at a normal speed.”  He stood still and said,  “Stop, stop, ascetic!”  “I’ve stopped, Aṅgulimāla—now you stop.”  Then Aṅgulimāla thought,  “These ascetics who follow the Sakyan speak the truth.  Yet while walking the ascetic Gotama says:  ‘I’ve stopped, Aṅgulimāla—now you stop.’  Why don’t I ask him about this?”  Then he addressed the Buddha in verse:  “While walking, ascetic, you say ‘I’ve stopped.’  And I have stopped, but you tell me I’ve not.  I’m asking you this, ascetic:  how is it you’ve stopped and I have not?”  “Aṅgulimāla, I have forever stopped— I’ve laid aside violence towards all creatures.  But you can’t stop yourself <j>from harming living creatures;  that’s why I’ve stopped, but you have not.”  “Oh, at long last a renowned great seer,  an ascetic has followed me into this deep wood.  Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma,  I shall live without evil.”  With these words, <j>the bandit hurled his sword and weapons  down a cliff into an abyss.  He venerated the Holy One’s feet,  and asked him for the going forth right away.  Then the Buddha, the compassionate great seer,  the teacher of the world with its gods,  said to him, “Come, monk!”  And with that he became a monk.  Then the Buddha set out for Sāvatthī with Venerable Aṅgulimāla as his second monk.  Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī,  where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time a crowd had gathered by the gate of King Pasenadi’s royal compound making a colossal racket,  “In your realm, Your Majesty, there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.  He has laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.  He is constantly murdering humans, and he wears their fingers as a necklace.  Your Majesty must put a stop to him!”  Then King Pasenadi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day with around five hundred horses,  heading for the monastery.  He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot. He bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,  “What is it, great king? Is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha angry with you, or the Licchavis of Vesālī, or some other opposing ruler?”  “No, sir.  In my realm there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings. …  I shall put a stop to him.”  “But great king, suppose you were to see that Aṅgulimāla had shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness. And that he was refraini",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 87  Born From the Beloved  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time a certain householder’s dear and beloved only child passed away.  After their death he didn’t feel like working or eating.  He would go to the cremation ground and wail,  “Where are you, my only child? Where are you, my only child?”  Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,  “Your faculties, householder, are those of one who is unstable in their own mind; there is a deterioration in your faculties.”  “And how, sir, could there be no deterioration of my faculties?  For my dear and beloved only child has passed away.  Since their death I haven’t felt like working or eating.  I go to the cremation ground and wail:  ‘Where are you, my only child? Where are you, my only child?’”  “That’s so true, householder! That’s so true, householder!  For our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”  “Sir, who on earth could ever think such a thing!  For our loved ones are a source of joy and happiness.”  Disagreeing with the Buddha’s statement, rejecting it, he got up from his seat and left.  Now at that time several gamblers were playing dice not far from the Buddha.  That householder approached them and told them what had happened.  “That’s so true, householder! That’s so true, householder!  For our loved ones are a source of joy and happiness.”  Thinking, “The gamblers and I are in agreement,” the householder left.  Eventually that topic of discussion reached the royal compound.  Then King Pasenadi addressed Queen Mallikā,  “Mallika, your ascetic Gotama said this:  ‘Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.’”  “If that’s what the Buddha said, great king, then that’s how it is.”  “No matter what the ascetic Gotama says, Mallikā agrees with him:  ‘If that’s what the Buddha said, great king, then that’s how it is.’  You’re just like a pupil who agrees with everything their tutor says.  Go away, Mallikā, get out of here!”  Then Queen Mallikā addressed the brahmin Nāḷijaṅgha,  “Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  And then say:  ‘Sir, did the Buddha make this statement:  “Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress”?’  Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me.  For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so.”  “Yes, ma’am,” he replied. He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,  “Worthy Gotama, Queen Mallikā bows with her head to your feet. She asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  And she asks whether  the Buddha made this statement:  ‘Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.’”  “That’s right, brahmin, that’s right!  For our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.  And here’s a way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.  Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain woman’s mother passed away.  And because of that she went mad and lost her mind. She went from street to street and from square to square saying,  ‘Has anyone seen my mother? Has anyone seen my mother?’  And here’s another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.  Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain woman’s father …  brother …  sister …  son …  daughter …  husband passed away.  And because of that she went mad and lost her mind. She went from street to street and from square to square saying,  ‘Has anyone seen my husband? Has anyone seen my husband?’  And here’s another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.  Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain man’s mother …  father …  brother …  sister …  son …  daughter …  wife passed away.  And because of that he went mad and lost his mind. He went from street to street and from square to square saying,  ‘Has anyone seen my wife? Has anyone seen my wife?’  And here’s another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.  Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain woman went to live with her relative’s family.  But her relatives wanted to divorce her from her husband and give her to another,  who she didn’t want.  So she told her husband about this.  But he cut her in two and disemboweled himself, thinking,  ‘We shall be together after death.’  That’s another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”  Then Nāḷ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 88  The Imported Cloth  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.  He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, for the day’s meditation.  Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala mounted the Single Lotus Elephant and drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day.  He saw Ānanda coming off in the distance  and said to the chief minister Sirivaḍḍha,  “My dear Sirivaḍḍha, isn’t that Venerable Ānanda?”  “Indeed it is, great king.”  Then King Pasenadi addressed a man,  “Please, worthy man, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:  ‘Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala bows with his head at your feet.’  And then say:  ‘Sir, if you have no urgent business, please wait an hour out of sympathy.’”  “Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. He did as the king asked.  Ānanda consented with silence.  Then King Pasenadi rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Ānanda on foot. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Ānanda,  “Sir, if you have no urgent business, it would be nice of you to go to the bank of the Aciravatī river out of sympathy.”  Ānanda consented with silence.  He went to the river bank and sat at the root of a certain tree on a seat spread out.  Then King Pasenadi rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Ānanda on foot. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Ānanda,  “Here, Venerable Ānanda, sit on this elephant rug.”  “Enough, great king,  you sit on it.  I’m sitting on my own seat.”  So the king sat down on the seat spread out,  and said,  “Honorable Ānanda, would the Buddha engage in the sort of behavior—by way of body, speech, or mind—that is faulted by ascetics and brahmins?”  “No, great king, the Buddha would not engage in the sort of behavior that is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”  “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!  For I couldn’t fully express the question, but Venerable Ānanda’s answer completed it for me.  I don’t believe that praise or criticism of others spoken by incompetent fools, without examining or scrutinizing, is the most important thing.  Rather, I believe that praise or criticism of others spoken by competent and intelligent people after examining and scrutinizing is the most important thing.  But Honorable Ānanda, what kind of bodily behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?”  “Unskillful behavior.”  “But what kind of bodily behavior is unskillful?”  “Blameworthy behavior.”  “But what kind of bodily behavior is blameworthy?”  “Hurtful behavior.”  “But what kind of bodily behavior is hurtful?”  “Behavior that results in suffering.”  “But what kind of bodily behavior results in suffering?”  “Bodily behavior that leads to hurting yourself, hurting others, and hurting both,  and which makes unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline.  That kind of bodily behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”  “But what kind of verbal behavior …  mental behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?” …  “Mental behavior that leads to hurting yourself, hurting others, and hurting both,  and which makes unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline.  That kind of mental behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”  “Sir, does the Buddha praise giving up all these unskillful things?”  “Great king, the Realized One has given up all unskillful things and possesses skillful things.”  “But sir, what kind of bodily behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?”  “Skillful behavior.”  “But what kind of bodily behavior is skillful?”  “Blameless behavior.”  “But what kind of bodily behavior is blameless?”  “Pleasing behavior.”  “But what kind of bodily behavior is pleasing?”  “Behavior that results in happiness.”  “But what kind of bodily behavior results in happiness?”  “Bodily behavior that leads to pleasing yourself, pleasing others, and pleasing both,  and which makes unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow.  That kind of bodily behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”  “But what kind of verbal behavior …  mental behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?” …  “Mental behavior that leads to pleasing yourself, pleasing others, and pleasing both,  and which makes unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow.  That kind of mental behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”  “Sir, does the Buddha praise embracing all these skillful things?”  “Great king, the Realized One has given up all unskillful things and possesses skillful things.”  “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 89  Shrines to the Teaching  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near the Sakyan town named Medaḷumpa.  Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Townsville on some business.  Then he addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,  “My good Kārāyana, harness the finest chariots. We will go to a park and see the scenery.”  “Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Dīgha Kārāyana. He harnessed the chariots and informed the king,  “Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.  Please go at your convenience.”  Then King Pasenadi mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Townsville,  heading for the park grounds.  He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the park on foot.  As he was going for a walk in the park he saw roots of trees that were impressive and inspiring, quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.  The sight reminded him right away of the Buddha:  “These roots of trees, so impressive and inspiring, are like those where we used to pay homage to the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”  He addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,  “These roots of trees, so impressive and inspiring, are like those where we used to pay homage to the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  My good Kārāyana, where is that Buddha at present?”  “Great king, there is a Sakyan town named Medaḷumpa.  That’s where the Buddha is now staying.”  “But how far away is that town?”  “Not far, great king,  it’s three leagues.  We can get there while it’s still light.”  “Well then, harness the chariots, and we shall go to see the Buddha.”  “Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Dīgha Kārāyana. He harnessed the chariots and informed the king,  “Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.  Please go at your convenience.”  Then King Pasenadi mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Townsville to Medaḷumpa.  He reached the town while it was still light  and headed for the monastery grounds.  He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.  At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.  King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to them and said,  “Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?  For I want to see him.”  “Great king, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the door-panel. The Buddha will open the door.”  The king right away presented his sword and turban to Dīgha Kārāyana,  who thought,  “Now the king seeks privacy. I should wait here.”  Then the king approached the Buddha’s dwelling, cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel, and the Buddha opened the door.  King Pasenadi entered the dwelling, and bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:  “Sir, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!  I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”  “But great king, for what reason do you demonstrate such utmost devotion for this body, conveying your manifest love?”  “Sir, I infer about the Buddha from the teaching:  ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’  It happens, sir, that I see some ascetics and brahmins leading the spiritual life only for a limited period: ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years.  Some time later—nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed—they amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.  But here I see the mendicants leading the spiritual life entirely full and pure as long as they live, to their last breath.  I don’t see any other spiritual life elsewhere so full and pure.  That’s why I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:  ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’  Furthermore, kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend.  But here I see the mendicants living in harmony, appreciating each other, without dispute, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.  I don’t see any other assembly elsewhere so harmonious.  So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:  ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’  Furthermore, I have walked and wandered from monastery to monastery and from park to park.  There I’ve seen some ascetics and brahmins who are thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—h",

Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujuññā on some business.  Then he addressed a man,  “Please, worthy man, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.  And then say:  ‘Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see you today when he has finished breakfast.’”  “Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. He did as the king asked.  The sisters Somā and Sakulā heard this.  While the meal was being served, they approached the king and said,  “Great king, since you are going to the Buddha, please bow in our name with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”  When he had finished breakfast, King Pasenadi went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā bow with their heads to your feet. They ask if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”  “But, great king, couldn’t they get any other messenger?”  So Pasenadi explained the circumstances of the message.  The Buddha said, “May the sisters Somā and Sakulā be happy, great king.”  Then the king said to the Buddha,  “I have heard, sir, that the ascetic Gotama says this:  ‘There is no ascetic or brahmin who will ever claim to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception: that is not possible.’  Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”  “Great king, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.”  Then King Pasenadi addressed General Viḍūḍabha,  “General, who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound?”  “It was Sañjaya, great king, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan.”  Then the king addressed a man,  “Please, worthy man, in my name tell Sañjaya that  King Pasenadi summons him.”  “Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. He did as the king asked.  Then the king said to the Buddha,  “Sir, might the Buddha have spoken in reference to one thing, but that person believed it was something else?  How then do you recall making this statement?”  “Great king, I recall making this statement:  ‘There is no ascetic or brahmin who will ever know all and see all simultaneously: that is not possible.’”  “What the Buddha says appears reasonable.  Sir, there are these four classes:  aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.  Is there any difference between them?”  “Of the four classes, two are said to be preeminent— the aristocrats and the brahmins.  That is, when it comes to bowing down, rising up, greeting with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette.”  “Sir, I am not asking you about this life,  but about the life to come.”  “Great king, there are these five factors that support meditation.  What five?  It’s when a mendicant has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.  They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.  They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.  They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.  These are the five factors that support meditation.  There are these four classes:  aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.  If they had these five factors that support meditation,  that would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”  “Sir, there are these four classes:  aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.  If they had these five factors that support meditation,  would there be any difference between them?”  “In that case, I say it is the disparity of their efforts in meditation.  Suppose there was a pair of elephants or horses or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained. And there was a pair who were not tamed or trained.  What do you think, great king?  Wouldn’t the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed, and reach the level of the tamed?”  “Yes, sir.”  “But would the pair that was not tamed and trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed, just like the tamed pair?”  “No, sir.”  “In the ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 91  With Brahmāyu  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Videhans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.  Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu was residing in Mithilā. He was old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life; he was a hundred and twenty years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.  He heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is wandering in the land of the Videhans, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu had a pupil named Uttara. He too had mastered the Vedic curriculum.  Brahmāyu told Uttara of the Buddha’s presence in the land of the Videhans, and added:  “Please, dear Uttara, go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation.  Through you I shall learn about the worthy Gotama.”  “But sir, how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation?”  “Dear Uttara, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.  If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.  He has the following seven treasures:  the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.  He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.  After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.  But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who has cast off the world’s veil.  But, dear Uttara, I am the one who gives the hymns,  and you are the one who receives them.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied Uttara. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Brahmāyu before setting out for the land of the Videhans where the Buddha was wandering.  Traveling stage by stage, he came to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,  and scrutinized his body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.  He saw all of them except for two,  which he had doubts about:  whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.  Then it occurred to the Buddha,  “This student Uttara sees all the marks except for two,  which he has doubts about:  whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.”  So the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Uttara would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.  And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.  Then Uttara thought,  “The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks.  Why don’t I follow him and observe his deportment?”  So Uttara followed the Buddha like a shadow for seven months.  When seven months had passed he set out wandering towards Mithilā.  There he approached the brahmin Brahmāyu, bowed, and sat down to one side. Brahmāyu said to him,  “Well, dear Uttara, does the worthy Gotama live up to his reputation or not?”  “He does, sir.  The worthy Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks.  He has well-planted feet.  On the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail.  He has stretched heels.  He has long fingers.  His hands and feet are tender.  He has serried hands and feet.  The tops of his feet are arched.  His calves are like those of an antelope.  When standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees.  His private parts are covered in a foreskin.  He is golden colored; his skin shines like lustrous gold.  He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.  His hairs g",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 92  With Sela  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans when he arrived at a town of theirs named Āpaṇa.  The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  So Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.  The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.  Then he said to the Buddha,  “Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”  When he said this, the Buddha said to him,  “The Saṅgha is large, Keṇiya; there are 1,250 mendicants. And you are devoted to the brahmins.”  For a second time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering.  “Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.  Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”  And for a second time, the Buddha gave the same reply.  For a third time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering.  “Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.  Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”  The Buddha consented with silence.  Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage. There he addressed his friends and colleagues, relatives and kin,  “My friends and colleagues, relatives and kin: please listen!  The ascetic Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal.  Please help me out with the manual preparations.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” they replied. Some dug ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water jar, and some spread out seats.  Meanwhile, Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself.  Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in Āpaṇa. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And he was teaching three hundred young students to recite the hymns.  And at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela.  Then Sela, while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred young students, approached Keṇiya’s hermitage.  He saw the preparations going on,  and said to Keṇiya,  “Keṇiya, is your son or daughter being married? Or are you setting up a big sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow’s meal?”  “There is no marriage, Sela, and the king is not coming.  Rather, I am setting up a big sacrifice.  The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”  “Worthy Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?”  “I said ‘the awakened one’.”  “Did you say ‘the awakened one’?”  “I said ‘the awakened one’.”  Then Sela thought,  “It’s hard to even find the word ‘awakened one’ in the world.  The thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.  If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.  He has the following seven treasures:  the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.  He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.  After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.  But if he go",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 93  With Assalāyana  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Sāvatthī on some business.  Then those brahmins thought,  “This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.  Who is capable of debating with him about this?”  Now at that time the student Assalāyana was residing in Sāvatthī. He was young, tonsured, and sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.  Then those brahmins thought,  “This Assalāyana is capable of debating with the ascetic Gotama about this.”  So they approached Assalāyana and said to him,  “This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.  Please, worthy Assalāyana, debate with the ascetic Gotama about this.”  When they said this, Assalāyana said to them,  “They say that the ascetic Gotama is a speaker of principle.  But speakers of principle are hard to debate.  I’m not capable of debating with the ascetic Gotama about this.”  For a second time, those brahmins said to him  “This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.  Please, worthy Assalāyana, debate with the ascetic Gotama about this.  For you have lived as a wanderer.”  And for a second time, Assalāyana refused.  For a third time, those brahmins said to him,  “This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.  Please, worthy Assalāyana, debate with the ascetic Gotama about this.  For you have lived as a wanderer.  Don’t admit defeat before going into battle!”  When they said this, Assalāyana said to them,  “Clearly, good fellows, I’m not getting through to you when I say:  ‘They say that the ascetic Gotama is a speaker of principle.  But speakers of principle are hard to debate.  I’m not capable of debating with the ascetic Gotama about this.’  Nevertheless, I shall go at your bidding.”  Then Assalāyana together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:  “Worthy Gotama, the brahmins say:  ‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.  Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.  Only brahmins are purified, not others.  Only brahmins are true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’  What do you say about this?”  “But Assalāyana, brahmin women are seen menstruating, being pregnant, giving birth, and breastfeeding.  Yet even though they’re born from a brahmin womb they say:  ‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.  Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.  Only brahmins are purified, not others.  Only brahmins are true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’”  “Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”  “What do you think, Assalāyana?  Have you heard that in Greece and Persia and other foreign lands there are only two classes, masters and bonded servants; and that masters may become servants, and servants masters?”  “Yes, I have heard that.”  “Then what is the source of the brahmins’ certainty and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claim?”  “Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”  “What do you think, Assalāyana?  Suppose an aristocrat were to kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct; to use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and to be covetous, malicious, with wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Would this happen only to an aristocrat, and not to a brahmin?  Or suppose a peasant,  or a menial were to act in the same way. Would that result befall only a peasant or a menial, and not to a brahmin?”  “No, worthy Gotama.  If they acted the same way, the same result would befall an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial.  For if any of the four classes were to kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct; to use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and to be covetous, malicious, with wrong view, then, when their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”  “Then what is the source of the brahmins’ certainty and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claim?”  “Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”  “What do you think, Assalāyana?

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 94  With Ghoṭamukha  So I have heard.  At one time Venerable Udena was staying near Varanasi in the Khemiya Mango Grove.  Now at that time the brahmin Ghoṭamukha had arrived at Varanasi on some business.  Then as he was going for a walk he went to the Khemiya Mango Grove.  At that time Venerable Udena was walking mindfully in the open air.  Ghoṭamukha approached and exchanged greetings with him.  Walking alongside Udena, he said,  “Worthy ascetic, there is no such thing as a principled renunciate life;  that’s what I think.  Yet I have not seen honorable ones such as yourself, or a relevant teaching.”  When he said this, Udena stepped down from the walking path, entered his dwelling, and sat down on the seat spread out.  Ghoṭamukha also stepped down from the walking path and entered the dwelling, where he stood to one side.  Udena said to him,  “There are seats, brahmin.  Please sit if you wish.”  “I was just waiting for you to sit down.  For how on earth could one such as I presume to sit first without being invited?”  Then he took a low seat and sat to one side,  where he said,  “Worthy ascetic, there is no such thing as a principled renunciate life;  that’s what I think.  Yet I have not seen honorable ones such as yourself, or a relevant teaching.”  “Brahmin, we can discuss this. But only if you grant what should be granted, and reject what should be rejected. And if you ask me the meaning of anything you don’t understand, saying:  ‘Sir, why is this? What does that mean?’”  “Let us discuss this. I will do as you say.”  “Brahmin, these four individuals are found in the world.  What four?  One individual mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.  One individual mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others.  One individual mortifies themselves and others, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.  One individual doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.  They live without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine.  Which one of these four individuals do you like the sound of?”  “Sir, I don’t like the sound of the first three individuals.  I only like the sound of the last individual, who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others.”  “But why don’t you like the sound of those three individuals?”  “Sir, the individual who mortifies themselves does so even though they want to be happy and recoil from pain.  That’s why I don’t like the sound of that individual.  The individual who mortifies others does so even though others want to be happy and recoil from pain.  That’s why I don’t like the sound of that individual.  The individual who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from pain.  That’s why I don’t like the sound of that individual.  The individual who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others—living without wishes, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine—does not torment themselves or others, both of whom want to be happy and recoil from pain.  That’s why I like the sound of that individual.”  “There are, brahmin, these two groups of people.  What two?  There’s one group of people who, being obsessed with jeweled earrings, seeks partners and children, male and female bondservants, fields and lands, and gold and currency.  And there’s another group of people who, not being obsessed with jeweled earrings, has given up partner and children, male and female bondservants, fields and lands, and gold and currency, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness.  Now, brahmin, that individual who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others— in which of these two groups of people do you usually find such an individual?”  “I usually find such an individual in  the group that has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.”  “Just now I understood you to say:  ‘Worthy ascetic, there is no such thing as a principled renunciate life;  that’s what I think.  Yet I have not seen honorable ones such as yourself, or a relevant teaching.”  “Well, I obviously had my reasons for saying that, master Udena.  But there is such a thing as a principled renunciate life.  That’s what I think,  and that’s how you should remember me.  Now, these four individuals that you’ve spoken of in a brief summary: please explain them to me in detail, out of sympathy.”  “Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied Ghoṭamukha.  Udena said this:  “What individual mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves?  It’s when an individual goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.  They don’t receive anything from a pot or ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 95  With Caṅkī  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Opāsāda.  He stayed in the Godswood of sal trees to the north of Opāsāda.  Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī was living in Opāsāda. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.  The brahmins and householders of Opāsāda heard:  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He is staying in the Godswood to the north.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Then, exiting Opāsāda, they formed into companies and headed north to the Godswood.  Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap.  He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the Godswood,  and addressed his butler,  “My butler, why are the brahmins and householders heading north for the Godswood?”  “The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He is staying in the Godswood to the north.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  They’re going to see that worthy Gotama.”  “Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them:  ‘Sirs, the brahmin Caṅkī asks  you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’”  “Yes, sir,” replied the butler, and did as he was asked.  Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Opāsāda on some business.  They heard that  the brahmin Caṅkī was going to see the ascetic Gotama.  They approached Caṅkī and said to him,  “Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?”  “Yes, gentlemen, it is true.”  “Please don’t!  It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;  it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.  You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.  For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;  it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.  You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy. …  You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. You know them word-by-word, and their grammar. You are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. …  You are attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. You have divine looks and lustre, remarkable to behold. …  You are ethical, mature in ethical conduct. …  You’re a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. …  You teach the tutors of many, and teach three hundred young students to recite the hymns. …  You’re honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Pasenadi of Kosala  and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. …  You live in Opāsāda, a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.  For all these reasons it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;  it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.”  When they had spoken, Caṅkī said to those brahmins:  “Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it’s appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama,  and it’s not appropriate for him to come to see me.  He is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.  For this reason it’s not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me;  rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him.  When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold, both coined and uncoined, stored above and below ground. …  He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with",

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:  “Worthy Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four kinds of service:  for a brahmin, an aristocrat, a peasant, and a menial.  This is the service they prescribe for a brahmin:  ‘A brahmin, an aristocrat, a peasant, and a menial may all serve a brahmin.’  This is the service they prescribe for an aristocrat:  ‘An aristocrat, a peasant, and a menial may all serve an aristocrat.’  This is the service they prescribe for a peasant:  ‘A peasant or a menial may serve a peasant.’  This is the service they prescribe for a menial:  ‘Only a menial may serve a menial.  For who else will serve a menial?’  These are the four kinds of service that the brahmins prescribe.  What do you say about this?”  “But brahmin, did the whole world authorize the brahmins to prescribe these four kinds of service?”  “No, worthy Gotama.”  “It’s as if they were to force a chop on a poor, penniless person, telling them, ‘Eat this meat and pay for it!’  In the same way, the brahmins have prescribed these four kinds of service without the consent of those ascetics and brahmins.  Brahmin, I don’t say that you should serve everyone, nor do I say that you shouldn’t serve anyone.  I say that you shouldn’t serve someone if serving them makes you worse, not better.  And I say that you should serve someone if serving them makes you better, not worse.  If they were to ask an aristocrat this,  ‘Who should you serve? Someone in whose service you get worse, or someone in whose service you get better?’  Answering rightly, an aristocrat would say,  ‘Someone in whose service I get better.’  If they were to ask a brahmin …  a peasant …  or a menial this,  ‘Who should you serve? Someone in whose service you get worse, or someone in whose service you get better?’  Answering rightly, a menial would say,  ‘Someone in whose service I get better.’  Brahmin, I don’t say that an eminent family makes you a better or worse person.  I don’t say that being very beautiful makes you a better or worse person.  I don’t say that being very wealthy makes you a better or worse person.  For some people from eminent families kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view.  That’s why I don’t say that an eminent family makes you an even truer person.  But some people from eminent families also refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re not covetous or malicious, and they have right view.  That’s why I don’t say that an eminent family makes you a worse person.  People who are very beautiful,  or not very beautiful,  who are very wealthy,  or not very wealthy,  may also behave in the same ways.  That’s why I don’t say that any of these things makes you a better or worse person.  Brahmin, I don’t say that you should serve everyone, nor do I say that you shouldn’t serve anyone.  And I say that you should serve someone if serving them makes you grow in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.  I say that you shouldn’t serve someone if serving them doesn’t make you grow in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.”  When he had spoken, Esukārī said to him:  “Worthy Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four kinds of wealth:  for a brahmin, an aristocrat, a peasant, and a menial.  The wealth they prescribe for a brahmin is living on alms.  A brahmin who scorns his own wealth, living on alms, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.  The wealth they prescribe for an aristocrat is the bow and quiver.  An aristocrat who scorns his own wealth, the bow and quiver, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.  The wealth they prescribe for a peasant is farming and animal husbandry.  A peasant who scorns his own wealth, farming and animal husbandry, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.  The wealth they prescribe for a menial is the scythe and flail.  A menial who scorns his own wealth, the scythe and flail, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.  These are the four kinds of wealth that the brahmins prescribe.  What do you say about this?”  “But brahmin, did the whole world authorize the brahmins to prescribe these four kinds of wealth?”  “No, worthy Gotama.”  “It’s as if they were to force a chop on a poor, penniless person, telling them, ‘Eat this meat and pay for it!’  In the same way, the brahmins have prescribed these four kinds of wealth without the consent of these ascetics and brahmins.  I declare that a person’s own wealth is the noble, transcendent teaching.  But they are reckoned by recollectin",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 97  With Dhanañjāni  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.  Then a certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in Rājagaha went to the Southern Hills, where he approached Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him,  “Reverend, I hope the Buddha is healthy and strong?”  “He is, reverend.”  “And I hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and strong.”  “It is.”  “Reverend, at the rice checkpoint at the city gate there is a brahmin named Dhanañjāni.  I hope that he is healthy and strong?”  “He too is well.”  “But is he diligent?”  “How could he possibly be diligent?  Dhanañjāni robs the brahmins and householders in the name of the king, and he robs the king in the name of the brahmins and householders.  His wife, a lady of faith who he married from a family of faith, has passed away.  And he has taken a new wife who has no faith.”  “Oh, it’s bad news  to hear that Dhanañjāni is negligent.  Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet him, and we can have a discussion.”  When Sāriputta had stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he pleased, he set out for Rājagaha.  Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Rājagaha,  where he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Then he robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.  Now at that time Dhanañjāni was having his cows milked in a cow-shed outside the city.  Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he approached Dhanañjāni.  Seeing Sāriputta coming off in the distance,  Dhanañjāni went to him and said,  “Here, worthy Sāriputta, drink some fresh milk before the meal time.”  “Enough, brahmin,  I’ve finished eating for today.  I shall be at the root of that tree for the day’s meditation.  Come see me there.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied Dhanañjāni.  When Dhanañjāni had finished breakfast he went to Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him,  “I hope you’re diligent, Dhanañjāni?”  “How can I possibly be diligent, worthy Sāriputta? I have to provide for my mother and father, my wives and children, and my bondservants and workers. And I have to make the proper offerings to friends and colleagues, relatives and kin, guests, ancestors, deities, and king. And then this body must also be fattened and built up.”  “What do you think, Dhanañjāni?  Suppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their parents. Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hell.  Could they get out of being dragged to hell by pleading that they had acted for the sake of their parents? Or could their parents save them by pleading that the acts had been done for their sake?”  “No, worthy Sāriputta.  Rather, even as they were wailing the wardens of hell would cast them down into hell.”  “What do you think, Dhanañjāni?  Suppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their wives and children …  bondservants and workers …  friends and colleagues …  relatives and kin …  guests …  ancestors …  deities …  king …  fattening and building up their body. Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hell.  Could they get out of being dragged to hell by pleading that they had acted for the sake of fattening and building up their body? Or could anyone else save them by pleading that the acts had been done for that reason?”  “No, worthy Sāriputta.  Rather, even as they were wailing the wardens of hell would cast them down into hell.”  “Who do you think is better, Dhanañjāni? Someone who, for the sake of their parents, behaves in an unprincipled and unjust manner, or someone who behaves in a principled and just manner?”  “Someone who behaves in a principled and just manner for the sake of their parents.  For principled and moral conduct is better than unprincipled and immoral conduct.”  “Dhanañjāni, others have livelihoods that are both profitable and legitimate. By means of these it’s possible to provide for your parents, avoid bad deeds, and practice the path of goodness.  Who do you think is better, Dhanañjāni? Someone who, for the sake of their wives and children …  bondservants and workers …  friends and colleagues …  relatives and kin …  guests …  ancestors …  deities …  king …  fattening and building up their body, behaves in an unprincipled and unjust manner, or someone who behaves in a principled and just manner?”  “Someone who behaves in a principled and just manner.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 98  With Vāseṭṭha  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.  Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included  the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.  Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question:  “How do you become a brahmin?”  Bhāradvāja said this:  “When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation— then you’re a brahmin.”  Vāseṭṭha said this:  “When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties— then you’re a brahmin.”  But neither was able to persuade the other.  So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja,  “Worthy Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter.  As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied Bhāradvāja.  So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side,  and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse:  “We’re both authorized masters  of the three Vedas.  I’m a student of Pokkharasāti,  and he of Tārukkha.  We’re fully qualified  in all the Vedic experts teach.  As philologists and grammarians,  we match our tutors in recitation.  We have a dispute  regarding genealogy.  For Bhāradvāja says that  one is a brahmin due to birth,  but I declare it’s because of one’s deeds.  Oh Clear-eyed One, know this as our debate.  Since neither of us was able  to convince the other,  we’ve come to ask you, sir,  renowned as the awakened one.  As people honor with joined palms  the moon on the cusp of waxing,  bowing, they revere  Gotama in the world.  We ask this of Gotama,  the Eye arisen in the world:  is one a brahmin due to birth,  or else because of deeds?  We don’t know, please tell us,  so we can recognize a brahmin.”  “I shall explain to you,”  said the Buddha,  “accurately and in sequence,  the taxonomy of living creatures,  for species are indeed diverse.  Know the grass and trees,  though they lack self-awareness.  They’re defined by birth,  for species are indeed diverse.  Next there are bugs and moths,  and so on, to ants and termites.  They’re defined by birth,  for species are indeed diverse.  Know the quadrupeds, too,  both small and large.  They’re defined by birth,  for species are indeed diverse.  Know, too, the long-backed snakes,  crawling on their bellies.  They’re defined by birth,  for species are indeed diverse.  Next know the fish,  whose range is the water.  They’re defined by birth,  for species are indeed diverse.  Next know the birds,  winged chariots in flight.  They’re defined by birth,  for species are indeed diverse.  While the differences between these species  are defined by birth,  the differences between humans  are not defined by birth.  Not by hair nor by head,  not by ear nor by eye,  not by mouth nor by nose,  not by lips nor by eyebrow,  not by shoulder nor by neck,  not by belly nor by back,  not by buttocks nor by breast,  not by groin nor by genitals,  not by hands nor by feet,  not by fingers nor by nails,  not by knees nor by thighs,  not by color nor by voice:  none of these are defined by birth  as it is for other species.  In specific human bodies  you can’t find such distinctions.  The distinctions among humans  are spoken of by convention.  Anyone among humans  who lives off keeping cattle:  know them, Vāseṭṭha,  as a farmer, not a brahmin.  Anyone among humans  who lives off various professions:  know them, Vāseṭṭha,  as a professional, not a brahmin.  Anyone among humans  who lives off trade:  know them, Vāseṭṭha,  as a trader, not a brahmin.  Anyone among humans  who lives off serving others:  know them, Vāseṭṭha,  as a servant, not a brahmin.  Anyone among humans  who lives off stealing:  know them, Vāseṭṭha,  as a bandit, not a brahmin.  Anyone among humans  who lives off archery:  know them, Vāseṭṭha,  as a soldier, not a brahmin.  Anyone among humans  who lives off priesthood:  know them, Vāseṭṭha,  as a sacrificer, not a brahmin.  Anyone among humans  who taxes village and nation,  know them, Vāseṭṭha,  as a ruler, not a brahmin.  I don’t call someone a brahmin  after the mother’s womb they’re born from.  If they still have attachments,  they’re just someone who says ‘worthy’.  Having nothing, taking nothing:  that’s who I declare a brahmin.  Having cut off all fetters  they have no anxiety;  they’ve slipped their chains and are detached:  that’s who I declare",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 99  With Subha  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, was residing in Sāvatthī at a certain householder’s home on some business.  Then Subha said to that householder,  “Householder, I have heard that  Sāvatthī does not lack for perfected ones.  What ascetic or brahmin might we pay homage to today?”  “Sir, the Buddha is staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  You can pay homage to him.”  Acknowledging that householder, Subha went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:  “Worthy Gotama, the brahmins say:  ‘Laypeople succeed in the system of the skillful teaching, not renunciates.’  What do you say about this?”  “On this point, student, I speak after analyzing the question,  not one-sidedly.  I don’t praise wrong practice for either laypeople or renunciates.  Because of wrong practice, neither laypeople nor renunciates succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.  I praise right practice for both laypeople and renunciates.  Because of right practice, both laypeople and renunciates succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.”  “Worthy Gotama, the brahmins say:  ‘Since the work of the lay life has many obligations, duties, issues, and undertakings it is very fruitful.  But since the work of the renunciate has few obligations, duties, issues, and undertakings it is not very fruitful.’  What do you say about this?”  “On this point, too, I speak after analyzing the question,  not one-sidedly.  Some work has many obligations, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it fails it’s not very fruitful.  Some work has many obligations, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it succeeds it is very fruitful.  Some work has few obligations, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it fails it’s not very fruitful.  Some work has few obligations, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it succeeds it is very fruitful.  And what work has many obligations, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it fails it’s not very fruitful?  Farming.  And what work has many obligations, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it succeeds it is very fruitful?  Again, it is farming.  And what work has few obligations, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it fails it’s not very fruitful?  Trade.  And what work has few obligations, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it succeeds it is very fruitful?  Again, it’s trade.  The lay life is like farming in that it’s work with many obligations and when it fails it’s not very fruitful;  but when it succeeds it is very fruitful.  The renunciate life is like trade in that it’s work with few obligations and when it fails it’s not very fruitful;  but when it succeeds it is very fruitful.”  “Worthy Gotama, the brahmins prescribe five things for making merit and succeeding in the skillful.”  “If you don’t mind,  please explain these in this assembly.”  “It’s no trouble when good fellows such as yourself are sitting here.”  “Well, speak then, student.”  “Worthy Gotama, truth is the first thing.  Fervor is the second thing.  Chastity is the third thing.  Recitation is the fourth thing.  Generosity is the fifth thing.  These are the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful.  What do you say about this?”  “Well, student, is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this:  ‘I declare the result of these five things after realizing it with my own insight’?”  “No, worthy Gotama.”  “Well, is there even a single tutor of the brahmins, or a tutor’s tutor, or anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors, who says this:  ‘I declare the result of these five things after realizing it with my own insight’?”  “No, worthy Gotama.”  “Well, what of the ancient seers of the brahmins, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught.  Did even they say:  ‘We declare the result of these five things after realizing it with our own insight’?”  “No, worthy Gotama.”  “So, student, it seems that there is not a single one of the brahmins,  not even anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors,  nor even the ancient seers of the brahmins  who says:  ‘We declare the result of these five things after realizing it with our own insight.’  Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.  In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be comparable t",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 100  With Saṅgārava  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.  Now at that time a brahmin lady named Dhanañjānī was residing at Caṇḍalakappa. She was devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.  Once, she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:  “Homage to him, the blessed one, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!  Homage to him, the blessed one, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!  Homage to him, the blessed one, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”  Now at that time the student Saṅgārava was residing in Caṇḍalakappa. He was young, newly tonsured; he was sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.  Hearing Dhanañjānī’s exclamation,  he said to her,  “The brahmin lady Dhanañjānī is a disgrace! Though brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are found, she praises that shaveling, that fake ascetic.”  “But dearest boy, you don’t understand the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.  If you did, you’d never think of abusing or insulting him.”  “Well then, ma’am, let me know when the Buddha arrives in Caṇḍalakappa.”  “I will, dearest,” she replied.  And then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the Kosalan lands, arrived at Caṇḍalakappa,  where he stayed in the mango grove of the Todeyya brahmins.  Dhanañjānī heard that he had arrived.  So she went to Saṅgārava and told him, adding,  “Please, dearest boy, go at your convenience.”  “Yes, ma’am,” replied Saṅgārava. He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:  “Worthy Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in this life.  Where do you stand regarding these?”  “I say there is a disparity among those who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in this life.  There are some ascetics and brahmins who are oral transmitters.  Through oral transmission they claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life.  For example, the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas.  There are some ascetics and brahmins who solely by mere faith claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life.  For example, those who rely on logic and inquiry.  There are some ascetics and brahmins who, having directly known for themselves the principle regarding teachings not learned before from another, claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life.  I am one of those.  And here’s a way to understand that I am one of them.  Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:  ‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.  It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.  Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’  Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.  Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,  ‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’  Āḷāra Kālāma replied,  ‘Stay, venerable.  This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’  I quickly memorized that teaching.  As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.  Then it occurred to me,  ‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”  Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’  So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him:  ‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’  When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.  Then it occurred to me,  ‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,  energy,  mindfulness,  immersion,  and wisdom; I too have these things.  Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’  I quickly realized that teachi",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 101  At Devadaha  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near the Sakyan town named Devadaha.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:  ‘Everything this individual person experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds.  So, due to eliminating past deeds by fervent mortification, and not doing any new deeds, there’s nothing to come up in the future.  With no future consequence, deeds end. With the ending of deeds, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.’  Such is the doctrine of the Jain ascetics.  I’ve gone up to the Jain ascetics who say this and said,  ‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’  They admitted that it is.  I said to them,  ‘But reverends, do you know  for sure that you existed in the past, and it is not the case that you did not exist?’  ‘No we don’t, reverend.’  ‘But reverends, do you know  for sure that you did bad deeds in the past?’  ‘No we don’t, reverend.’  ‘But reverends, do you know  that you did such and such bad deeds?’  ‘No we don’t, reverend.’  ‘But reverends, do you know  that so much suffering has already been worn away? Or that so much suffering still remains to be worn away? Or that when so much suffering is worn away all suffering will have been worn away?’  ‘No we don’t, reverend.’  ‘But reverends, do you know  about giving up unskillful qualities in this very life and embracing skillful qualities?’  ‘No we don’t, reverend.’  ‘So it seems that you don’t know any of these things.  In that case, it’s not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this.  Now, supposing you did know these things.  In that case, it would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this.  Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison,  causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.  Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a surgeon to treat them.  The surgeon would cut open the wound with a scalpel,  causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.  They’d probe for the arrow,  causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.  They’d extract the arrow,  causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.  They’d apply cauterizing medicine to the wound,  causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.  After some time that wound would be healed and the skin regrown. They’d be healthy, happy, autonomous, master of themselves, able to go where they wanted.  They’d think,  “Earlier I was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison,  causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.  My friends and colleagues, relatives and kin got a surgeon to treat me.  At each step, the treatment was painful.  But these days that wound is healed and the skin regrown. I’m healthy, happy, autonomous, my own master, able to go where I want.”  In the same way, reverends, if you knew about these things,  it would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this.  But since you don’t know any of these things,  it’s not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this.’  When I said this, those Jain ascetics said to me,  ‘Reverend, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:  “Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.”  He says:  “O reverend Jain ascetics, you have done bad deeds in a past life. Wear them away with these severe and grueling austerities.  And when in the present you are restrained in body, speech, and mind, you’re not doing any bad deeds for the future.  So, due to eliminating past deeds by fervent mortification, and not doing any new deeds, there’s nothing to come up in the future.  With no future consequence, deeds end. With the ending of deeds, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.”  We endorse and accept this, and we are satisfied with it.’  When they said this, I said to them,  ‘These five things can be seen to turn out in two different ways.  What five?  Faith, endorsement, oral transmission, reasoned train of thought, and acceptance of a view after deliberation.  These are the five things that can be seen to turn out in two different ways.  In this case, what faith in your teacher do you have when it comes to the past? What endorsement, oral transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after deliberation?’  When I said this, I did not see any legitimate defense of their doctrine from the Jains.  Furthermore, I said to those Jain ascetics,  ‘What do you think, reverends?  At a time of intense exertion and striving do you suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings d",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 102  The Five and Three  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, there are some ascetics and brahmins who speculate and theorize about the final end, and assert various hypotheses concerning the final end.  Some propose this: ‘The self is percipient and healthy after death.’  Some propose this: ‘The self is non-percipient and healthy after death.’  Some propose this: ‘The self is neither percipient nor non-percipient and healthy after death.’  But some assert the annihilation, eradication, and nonexistence of an existing being, while others propose extinguishment in this life.  Thus they assert an existent self that is free of disease after death; or they assert the annihilation of an existing being; while some propose extinguishment in this life.  In this way five become three, and three become five.  This is the summary recital of the five and three.  Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception. Or some among those who go beyond this propose universal consciousness, limitless and imperturbable.  The Realized One understands this as follows.  There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception.  Or some, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, propose the dimension of nothingness, limitless and imperturbable. They declare that this is the purest, highest, best, and supreme of all those perceptions, whether of form or of formlessness or of unity or of diversity.  ‘That much is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—<em>that</em> is real.’  Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.  Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless.  So they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death.  Why is that?  Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart, and that the state of non-perception is peaceful and sublime.  The Realized One understands this as follows.  There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless.  But if any ascetic or brahmin should say this:  ‘Apart from form, feeling, perception, and choices, I will describe the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and reappearing, its growth, increase, and maturity.’  That is not possible.  ‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—<em>that</em> is real.’  Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.  Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is neither percipient nor non-percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless.  So they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death, as well as those who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death.  Why is that?  Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart; that non-perception is a stupor; and that the state of neither perception nor non-perception is peaceful and sublime.  The Realized One understands this as follows.  There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is neither percipient nor non-percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless.  Some ascetics or brahmins assert the embracing of that dimension merely through the conditioned phenomena of what ought be seen, heard, thought, and known. But that is said to be a disastrous approach.  For that dimension is said to be not attainable by means of conditioned phenomena,  but only with a residue of conditioned phenomena.  ‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—<em>that</em> is real.’  Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.  Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation, eradication, and nonexistence of an existing being reject those who assert a self that is free of disease a",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 103  Is This What You Think Of Me?  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Kusinārā, in the Forest of Offerings.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, is this what you think of me?  ‘The ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state.’”  “No sir, we don’t think of you that way.”  “If you don’t think of me that way,  what then do you think of me?”  “We think of you this way:  ‘The Buddha is sympathetic and wants what’s best for us.  He teaches out of sympathy.’”  “So it seems you think  that I teach out of sympathy.  In that case, each and every one of you should train in the things I have taught from my direct knowledge, that is:  the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. You should train in these things in harmony, appreciating each other, without dispute.  As you do so, it may happen that two mendicants disagree about the teaching.  Now, you might think,  ‘These two venerables disagree on both the meaning and the phrasing.’ So you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable and say to them:  ‘The venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasing.  But the venerables should know that this is how  such disagreement on the meaning and the phrasing comes to be.  Please don’t get into a dispute about this.’  Then they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to them:  ‘The venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasing.  But the venerables should know that this is how  such disagreement on the meaning and the phrasing comes to be.  Please don’t get into a dispute about this.’  So you should remember what has been incorrectly memorized as incorrectly memorized and what has been correctly memorized as correctly memorized.  Remembering this, you should speak on the teaching and the training.  Now, you might think,  ‘These two venerables disagree on the meaning but agree on the phrasing.’ So you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable and say to them:  ‘The venerables disagree on the meaning but agree on the phrasing.  But the venerables should know that this is how  such disagreement on the meaning and agreement on the phrasing comes to be.  Please don’t get into a dispute about this.’  Then they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to them:  ‘The venerables disagree on the meaning but agree on the phrasing.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 104  At Sāmagāma  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near the village of Sāma.  Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had recently passed away at Pāvā.  With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, fighting, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words:  “You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”  You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics.  And the Jain Ñātika’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge.  And then, after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā, the novice Cunda went to see Venerable Ānanda at Sāma village. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.  Ānanda said to him,  “Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter.  Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.”  “Yes, sir,” replied Cunda.  Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and Ānanda informed him of what Cunda had said. He went on to say,  “Sir, it occurs to me:  ‘When the Buddha has passed away, let no dispute arise in the Saṅgha.  For such a dispute would be for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.’”  “What do you think, Ānanda?  Do you see even two mendicants whose opinion differs regarding the things I have taught from my direct knowledge, that is,  the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path?”  “No, sir, I do not.  Nevertheless, there are some individuals who appear to live obedient to the Buddha, but when the Buddha has passed away they might create a dispute in the Saṅgha regarding livelihood or the monastic code.  Such a dispute would be for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.”  “Ānanda, dispute about livelihood or the monastic code is a minor matter.  But should a dispute arise in the Saṅgha concerning the path or the practice, that would be for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.  Ānanda, there are these six roots of dispute.  What six?  Firstly, a mendicant is irritable and acrimonious.  Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.  They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.  If you see such a root of dispute in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing.  If you don’t see it, you should practice so that it doesn’t come up in the future.  That’s how to give up this bad root of dispute, so it doesn’t come up in the future.  Furthermore, a mendicant is offensive and contemptuous …  They’re jealous and stingy …  They’re devious and deceitful …  They have corrupt wishes and wrong view …  They’re attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.  Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.  They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.  If you see such a root of dispute in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing.  If you don’t see it, you should practice so that it doesn’t come up in the future.  That’s how to give up this bad root of dispute, so it doesn’t come up in the future.  These are the six roots of dispute.  There are four kinds of disciplinary issues.  What four?  Disciplinary issues due to disputes, accusations, offenses, or business.  These are the four kinds of disciplinary issues.  There are seven methods for the settlement of any disciplinary issues that might arise.  Resolution face-to-face to be applied. Resolution through recollection to be granted. Resolution because o",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 105  With Sunakkhatta  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.  Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence:  “We understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’”  Sunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about this.  He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, I have heard that  several mendicants have declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence.  I trust they did so rightly—or are there some who declared enlightenment out of overestimation?”  “Some of them did so rightly, Sunakkhatta, while others did so out of overestimation.  Now, when mendicants declare enlightenment rightly, that is their truth.  But when mendicants declare enlightenment out of overestimation, the Realized One thinks:  ‘I should teach them the Dhamma.’  If the Realized One thinks  he should teach them the Dhamma,  but then certain futile men, having carefully planned a question, approach the Realized One and ask it,  then the Realized One  changes his mind.”  “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!  Let the Buddha teach the Dhamma. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”  “Well then, Sunakkhatta, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” replied Sunakkhatta.  The Buddha said this:  “Sunakkhatta, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.  What five?  Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  Sounds known by the ear …  Smells known by the nose …  Tastes known by the tongue …  Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.  It’s possible that a certain individual person may be intent on worldly pleasures of the flesh.  Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it rewarding.  But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it rewarding.  Suppose a person had left their own village or town long ago,  and they saw another person who had only recently left there.  They would ask about whether their village was safe, with plenty of food and little disease,  and the other person would tell them the news.  What do you think, Sunakkhatta?  Would that person want to listen to that other person? Would they actively listen and try to understand? Would they associate with that person, and find it rewarding?”  “Yes, sir.”  “In the same way, it’s possible that a certain individual may be intent on worldly pleasures of the flesh.  Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it rewarding.  But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it rewarding.  You should know of them:  ‘That individual is intent on pleasures of the flesh, for they’re detached from things connected with the imperturbable.’  It’s possible that a certain individual person may be intent on the imperturbable.  Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it rewarding.  But when talk connected with worldly pleasures of the flesh is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it rewarding.  Suppose there was a fallen, withered leaf. It’s incapable of becoming green again.  In the same way, an individual intent on the imperturbable has dropped the connection with worldly pleasures of the flesh.  You should know of them:  ‘That individual is intent on the imperturbable, for they’re detached from things connected with pleasures of the flesh.’  It’s possible that a certain individual person may be intent on the dimension of nothingness.  Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it rewarding.  But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it rewarding.  Suppose there was a broad rock that had been broken in half, so that it could not be put back together again.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 106  Conducive to the Imperturbable  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, sensual pleasures are impermanent, hollow, false, and deceptive.  This is made by illusion, mendicants, lamented by fools.  Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,  sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come;  both of these are Māra’s dominion, Māra’s domain, Māra’s lair, and Māra’s range.  They conduce to bad, unskillful notions such as desire, ill will, and aggression.  And they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training here.  A noble disciple reflects on this:  ‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,  sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come;  both of these are Māra’s dominion, Māra’s domain, Māra’s lair, and Māra’s range.  They conduce to bad, unskillful notions such as desire, ill will, and aggression.  And they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training here.  Why don’t I meditate with an abundant, expansive heart, having mastered the world and stabilized the mind?  Then I will have no more bad, unskillful notions such as desire, ill will, and aggression.  And by giving them up my mind, no longer limited, will become limitless and well developed.’  Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.  Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom.  When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that that conducive consciousness will be reborn in the imperturbable.  This is said to be the first way of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable.  Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:  ‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,  sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come;  whatever form there is, all form is the four principal states, or form derived from the four principal states.’  Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.  Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom.  When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that that conducive consciousness will be reborn in the imperturbable.  This is said to be the second way of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable.  Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:  ‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,  sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come,  visions in this life and in lives to come,  perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come;  all of these are impermanent.  And what’s impermanent is not worth approving, welcoming, or clinging to.’  Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.  Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom.  When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that that conducive consciousness will be reborn in the imperturbable.  This is said to be the third way of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable.  Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:  ‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,  sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come,  visions in this life and in lives to come,  perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come,  and perceptions of the imperturbable;  all are perceptions.  Where they cease without anything left over, that is peaceful, that is sublime,  namely the dimension of nothingness.’  Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.  Being confident, they either attain the dimension of nothingness now, or are freed by wisdom.  When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that that conducive consciousness will be reborn in the dimension of nothingness.  This is said to be the first way of practice suitable for attaining the dimension of nothingness.  Furthermore, a noble disciple has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:  ‘This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self.’  Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.  Being confident, they either attain the dimension of nothingness now, or are freed by wisdom.  When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that that conducive consciousness will be reborn in the dimension of nothingness.  This is said to be the second way of practice suitable for attaining the dimension of nothingness.  Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:  ‘I don’t belong to anyone anywhere!

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 107  With Moggallāna the Accountant  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.  Then the brahmin Moggallāna the Accountant went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:  “Worthy Gotama, in this stilt longhouse we can see gradual progress  down to the last step of the staircase.  Among the brahmins we can see gradual progress  in recitation.  Among archers we can see gradual progress  in archery.  Among us accountants, who earn a living by accounting, we can see gradual progress  in mathematics.  For when we get an apprentice we first make them count:  ‘One one, two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens.’  We even make them count up to a hundred.  Is it possible to similarly describe a gradual training, gradual progress, and gradual practice in this teaching and training?”  “It is possible, brahmin.  Suppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred. First of all he’d make it get used to wearing the bit.  In the same way, when the Realized One gets a person fit for training they first guide them like this:  ‘Come, mendicant, be ethical and restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.’  When they have ethical conduct, the Realized One guides them further:  ‘Come, mendicant, guard your sense doors. When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details.  If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of sight, and achieve restraint over it.  When you hear a sound with your ears …  When you smell an odor with your nose …  When you taste a flavor with your tongue …  When you feel a touch with your body …  When you know an idea with your mind, don’t get caught up in the features and details.  If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of mind, and achieve its restraint.’  When they guard their sense doors, the Realized One guides them further:  ‘Come, mendicant, eat in moderation.  Reflect rationally on the food that you eat:  ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’  When they eat in moderation, the Realized One guides them further:  ‘Come, mendicant, be committed to wakefulness. Practice walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying your mind from obstacles. In the first watch of the night, continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle watch, lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last watch, get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying your mind from obstacles.’  When they are committed to wakefulness, the Realized One guides them further:  ‘Come, mendicant, have mindfulness and situational awareness. Act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.’  When they have mindfulness and situational awareness, the Realized One guides them further:  ‘Come, mendicant, frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.’  And they do so.  After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.  Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.  Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.  Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.  Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.  Giving up doubt, t",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 108  With Moggallāna the Guardian  So I have heard.  At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. It was not long after the Buddha had become fully quenched.  Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, being suspicious of King Pajjota, was having Rājagaha fortified.  Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.  Then it occurred to him,  “It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.  Why don’t I go to see the brahmin Moggallāna the Guardian at his place of work?”  So that’s what he did.  Moggallāna the Guardian saw Ānanda coming off in the distance  and said to him,  “Come, worthy Ānanda!  Welcome, worthy Ānanda!  It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.  Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”  Ānanda sat down on the seat spread out,  while Moggallāna took a low seat and sat to one side.  Then he said to Ānanda,  “Worthy Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by the worthy Gotama, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”  “No, brahmin, there is not.  For the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, and explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path.  And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later.”  But this conversation between Ānanda and Moggallāna the Guardian was left unfinished.  For just then the brahmin Vassakāra, a minister of Magadha, while supervising the work at Rājagaha, approached Ānanda at Moggallāna’s place of work and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda,  “Worthy Ānanda, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  So Ānanda told him of the conversation that they were having when Vassakāra arrived. Vassakāra said:  “Worthy Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who was appointed by the worthy Gotama, saying:  ‘This one will be your refuge when I have passed away,’ to whom you would now turn?”  “No, there is not.”  “But is there even a single mendicant who has been elected to such a position by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants?”  “No, there is not.”  “But since you lack a refuge, worthy Ānanda, what’s the reason for your harmony?”  “We don’t lack a refuge, brahmin,  we have a refuge.  The teaching is our refuge.”  “But worthy Ānanda, when asked whether there was even a single mendicant—either appointed by the Buddha,  or elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants— who serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away, to whom you now turn,  you replied, ‘No, there is not.’  But you say that the reason for your harmony is that you have  the teaching as a refuge.  How should I see the meaning of this statement?”  “The Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha laid down training rules and recited the monastic code for the mendicants.  On the day of the sabbath all of us who live in dependence on one village district gather together as one.  We invite one who transmits the code to recite it.  If anyone remembers an offense or transgression while they’re reciting, we make them act in line with the teaching and in line with the instructions.  It’s not the good fellows who make us act,  it’s the teaching that makes us act.”  “Worthy Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who you honor, respect, revere, venerate, and rely on?”  “There is not, brahmin.”  “Worthy Ānanda, when asked whether there was even a single mendicant—either appointed by the Buddha,  or elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants— who serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away, to whom you now turn,  you replied, ‘No, there is not.’  And when asked whether there is even a single mendicant who you honor, respect, revere, venerate, and rely on,  you replied, ‘There is not.’  How should I see the meaning of this statement?”  “There are ten inspiring things explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  We honor anyone in whom these things are found.  What ten?  It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.  They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned.  These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and penetrating them theoreticall",

Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,  “Sir, I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”  “Well then, mendicant, take your own seat and ask what you wish.”  That mendicant took his seat and said to the Buddha:  “Sir, are these the five grasping aggregates:  form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”  “Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha.  Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:  “But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?”  “These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.”  “But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”  “Neither.  The desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates is the grasping there.”  “But sir, can there be disparity in desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?”  “There can,” said the Buddha.  “It’s when someone thinks:  ‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, and such consciousness!’  That’s how there can be disparity in desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.”  “Sir, what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?”  “Any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form.  Any kind of feeling at all …  Any kind of perception at all …  Any kind of choices at all …  Any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of consciousness.  That’s the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates.”  “What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found?  What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling …  perception …  choices …  consciousness is found?”  “The four principal states are the reason why the aggregate of form is found.  Contact is the reason why the aggregates of feeling,  perception,  and choices are found.  Name and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found.”  “But sir, how does substantialist view come about?”  “It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.  They regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.  They regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.  They regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.  They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.  That’s how substantialist view comes about.”  “But sir, how does substantialist view not come about?”  “It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.  They don’t regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.  They don’t regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.  They don’t regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.  They don’t regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.  That’s how substantialist view does not come about.”  “Sir, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to form,  feeling,  perception,  choices,  and consciousness?”  “The pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification.  That form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.  Removing and giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape.  The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling …  perception …  choices …  consciousness: this is its gratification.  That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.  Removing and giving up desire and greed for consciousn",

Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.  Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed them,  “Mendicants, could an untrue person know of an untrue person:  ‘This worthy one is an untrue person’?”  “No, sir.”  “Good, mendicants!  It’s impossible, it can’t happen, that an untrue person could know of an untrue person:  ‘This worthy one is an untrue person.’  But could an untrue person know of a true person:  ‘This worthy one is a true person’?”  “No, sir.”  “Good, mendicants!  That too is impossible.  A untrue person has bad qualities, is devoted to untrue persons, and has the intentions, counsel, speech, actions, views, and giving of an untrue person.  And how does an untrue person have bad qualities?  It’s when an untrue person is faithless, shameless, imprudent, unlearned, lazy, unmindful, and witless.  That’s how an untrue person has bad qualities.  And how is an untrue person devoted to untrue persons?  It’s when an untrue person is a friend and companion of ascetics and brahmins who are faithless, shameless, imprudent, unlearned, lazy, unmindful, and witless.  That’s how an untrue person is devoted to untrue persons.  And how does an untrue person have the intentions of an untrue person?  It’s when an untrue person intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both.  That’s how an untrue person has the intentions of an untrue person.  And how does an untrue person offer the counsel of an untrue person?  It’s when an untrue person offers counsel that hurts themselves, hurts others, and hurts both.  That’s how an untrue person offers the counsel of an untrue person.  And how does an untrue person have the speech of an untrue person?  It’s when an untrue person uses speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical.  That’s how an untrue person has the speech of an untrue person.  And how does an untrue person have the action of an untrue person?  It’s when an untrue person kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct.  That’s how an untrue person has the actions of an untrue person.  And how does an untrue person have the view of an untrue person?  It’s when an untrue person has such a view:  ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’  That’s how an untrue person has the view of an untrue person.  And how does an untrue person give the gifts of an untrue person?  It’s when an untrue person gives a gift carelessly, not with their own hand, and thoughtlessly. They give the dregs, and they give without consideration for consequences.  That’s how an untrue person gives the gifts of an untrue person.  That untrue person—who has such bad qualities, frequents untrue persons, and has the intentions, counsel, speech, actions, views, and giving of an untrue person— when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in the place where untrue persons are reborn.  And what is the place where untrue persons are reborn?  Hell or the animal realm.  Mendicants, could a true person know of a true person:  ‘This worthy one is a true person’?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Good, mendicants!  It is possible that a true person could know of a true person:  ‘This worthy one is a true person.’  But could a true person know of an untrue person:  ‘This worthy one is an untrue person’?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Good, mendicants!  That too is possible.  A true person has good qualities, is devoted to true persons, and has the intentions, counsel, speech, actions, views, and giving of a true person.  And how does a true person have good qualities?  It’s when a true person is faithful, conscientious, prudent, learned, energetic, mindful, and wise.  That’s how a true person has good qualities.  And how is a true person devoted to true persons?

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 111  One by One  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Sāriputta is astute, mendicants.  He has great wisdom,  widespread wisdom,  laughing wisdom,  swift wisdom,  sharp wisdom,  and penetrating wisdom.  For a fortnight he practiced discernment of phenomena one by one.  And this is how he did it.  Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.  And he distinguished the phenomena of the first absorption one by one: placing and keeping and rapture and bliss and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.  He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.  He understood:  ‘So it seems that these phenomena, not having been, come to be; and having come to be, they flit away.’  Regarding those phenomena, he meditated without getting involved or shying away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, with mind free of boundaries.  He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’  Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.  Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, he entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.  And he distinguished the phenomena of the second absorption one by one: internal confidence and rapture and bliss and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.  He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.  He understood:  ‘So it seems that these phenomena, not having been, come to be; and having come to be, they flit away.’  Regarding those phenomena, he meditated without getting involved or shying away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, with mind free of boundaries.  He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’  Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.  Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, he entered and remained in the third absorption, where he meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’  And he distinguished the phenomena of the third absorption one by one: bliss and mindfulness and awareness and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.  He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.  He understood:  ‘So it seems that these phenomena, not having been, come to be; and having come to be, they flit away.’  Regarding those phenomena, he meditated without getting involved or shying away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, with mind free of boundaries.  He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’  Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.  Furthermore, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, he entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.  And he distinguished the phenomena of the fourth absorption one by one: equanimity and neutral feeling and mental unconcern due to tranquility and pure mindfulness and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.  He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.  He understood:  ‘So it seems that these phenomena, not having been, come to be; and having come to be, they flit away.’  Regarding those phenomena, he meditated without going near or going away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, with mind free of boundaries.  He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’  Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.  Furthermore, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, he entered and remained in the dimension of infinite space.  And he distinguished the phenomena of the dimension of infinite space one by one: the perception of the dimension of infinite space and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.  He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 112  The Sixfold Purification  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Take a mendicant who declares enlightenment:  ‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.”’  You should neither approve nor reject that mendicant’s statement.  Rather, you should question them:  ‘Reverend, these four kinds of expression have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  What four?  One speaks of the seen as seen, the heard as heard, the thought as thought, and the known as known.  These are the four kinds of expression rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  How does the venerable know and see regarding these four kinds of expression so that your mind is freed from defilements by not grasping?’  For a mendicant with defilements ended—who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their heart’s goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—it is in line with the teaching to answer:  ‘Regarding what is seen, reverends, I live without getting involved or shying away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, with mind free of boundaries.  Regarding what is heard …  thought …  or known, I live without getting involved or shying away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, with mind free of boundaries.  That is how I know and see regarding these four kinds of expression so that my mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.’  Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,  then ask a further question:  ‘Reverend, these five grasping aggregates have been rightly explained by the Buddha.  What five?  That is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.  These are the five grasping aggregates that have been rightly explained by the Buddha.  How does the venerable know and see regarding these five grasping aggregates so that your mind is freed from defilements by not grasping?’  For a mendicant with defilements ended it is in line with the teaching to answer:  ‘Reverends, knowing that form is powerless, faded, and unreliable, I understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency for form.  Knowing that feeling …  perception …  choices …  consciousness is powerless, faded, and unreliable, I understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency for consciousness.  That is how I know and see regarding these five grasping aggregates so that my mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.’  Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,  then ask a further question:  ‘Reverend, these six elements have been rightly explained by the Buddha.  What six?  The elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.  These are the six elements that have been rightly explained by the Buddha.  How does the venerable know and see regarding these six elements so that your mind is freed from defilements by not grasping?’  For a mendicant with defilements ended it is in line with the teaching to answer:  ‘Reverends, I’ve not taken the earth element as self, nor is there a self based on the earth element.  And I understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency based on the earth element.  I’ve not taken the water element …  fire element …  air element …  space element …  consciousness element as self, nor is there a self based on the consciousness element.  And I understand that my mind is freed through the ending of attraction based on the consciousness element.  That is how I know and see regarding these six elements so that my mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.’  Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,  then ask a further question:  ‘Reverend, these six interior and exterior sense fields have been rightly explained by the Buddha.  What six?  The eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, and the mind and ideas.  These are the six interior and exterior sense fields that have been rightly explained by the Buddha.  How does the venerable know and see regarding these six interior and exterior sense fields so that your mind ",

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I will teach you the qualities of a true person and the qualities of an untrue person.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “And what is a quality of an untrue person?  Take an untrue person who has gone forth from an eminent family.  They reflect:  ‘I have gone forth from an eminent family, unlike these other mendicants.’  And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that.  This is a quality of an untrue person.  A true person reflects:  ‘It’s not because of one’s eminent family that thoughts of greed, hate, or delusion come to an end.  Even if someone has not gone forth from an eminent family,  if they practice in line with the teaching, practice properly, and live in line with the teaching, they are worthy of honor and praise for that.’  Keeping the practice to themselves, they don’t glorify themselves and put others down on account of their eminent family.

This too is a quality of a true person.  Furthermore, take an untrue person who is well-known and famous.  They reflect:  ‘I’m well-known and famous.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 114  What Should and Should Not Be Cultivated  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition of the teaching on what should and should not be cultivated.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “I say that there are two kinds of bodily behavior:  that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.  And each of these is a kind of bodily behavior.  I say that there are two kinds of verbal behavior:  that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.  And each of these is a kind of verbal behavior.  I say that there are two kinds of mental behavior:  that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.  And each of these is a kind of mental behavior.  I say that there are two arisings of thought:  that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.  And each of these is an arising of thought.  I say that there are two acquisitions of perception:  that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.  And each of these is an acquisition of perception.  I say that there are two acquisitions of views:  that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.  And each of these is an acquisition of views.  I say that there are two kinds of incarnation:  that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.  And these are equally incarnation.”  When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Buddha,  “Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.  ‘I say that there are two kinds of bodily behavior:  that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.  And each of these is a kind of bodily behavior.’  That’s what the Buddha said,  but why did he say it?  You should not cultivate the kind of bodily behavior which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.  And you should cultivate the kind of bodily behavior which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.  And what kind of bodily behavior causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline?  It’s when someone kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.  They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.  They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.  That kind of bodily behavior causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.  And what kind of bodily behavior causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow?  It’s when someone gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.  They give up stealing. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.  They give up sexual misconduct. They don’t have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don’t have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.  That kind of bodily behavior causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.  ‘I say that there are two kinds of bodily behavior:  that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.  And each of these is a kind of bodily behavior.’  That’s what the Buddha said, and this is why he said it.  ‘I say that there are two kinds of verbal behavior:  that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.  And each of these is a kind of verbal behavior.’  That’s what the Buddha said,  but why did he say it?  You should not cultivate the kind of verbal behavior which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.  And you should cultivate the kind of verbal behavior which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.  And what kind of verbal behavior causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline?  It’s when someone lies. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, ",

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.  Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.  Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.  It’s like a fire that spreads from a hut made of reeds or grass, and burns down even a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with doors fastened and windows shuttered.  In the same way, whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.  Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.  Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.  So, the fool is dangerous, but the astute person is safe.  The fool is perilous, but the astute person is not.  The fool is hazardous, but the astute person is not.  There’s no danger, peril, or hazard that comes from the astute.  So you should train like this: ‘We shall be astute, we shall be inquirers.’”  When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,  “Sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘astute, an inquirer’?”  “Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant is skilled in the elements, in the sense fields, in dependent origination, and in the possible and the impossible.  That’s how a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘astute, an inquirer’.”  “But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”  “There are, Ānanda, these eighteen elements.  The eye element, sight element, and eye consciousness element.  The ear element, sound element, and ear consciousness element.  The nose element, smell element, and nose consciousness element.  The tongue element, taste element, and tongue consciousness element.  The body element, touch element, and body consciousness element.  The mind element, ideas element, and mind consciousness element.  When a mendicant knows and sees these eighteen elements,  they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”  “But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”  “There could, Ānanda.  There are these six elements:  the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.  When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements,  they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”  “But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”  “There could, Ānanda.  There are these six elements:  the elements of pleasure, pain, happiness, sadness, equanimity, and ignorance.  When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements,  they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”  “But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”  “There could, Ānanda.  There are these six elements:  the elements of sensuality and renunciation, malice and good will, and cruelty and harmlessness.  When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements,  they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”  “But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”  “There could, Ānanda.  There are these three elements:  the elements of the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, and the formless realm.  When a mendicant knows and sees these three elements,  they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”  “But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”  “There could, Ānanda.  There are these two elements:  the conditioned element and the unconditioned element.  When a mendicant knows and sees these two elements,  they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”  “But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in the sense fields’?”  “There are these six interior and exterior sense fields:  the eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, and the mind and ideas.  When a mendicant knows and sees these six interior and exterior sense fields,  they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the sense fields’.”  “But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in dependent origination’?”  “It’s when a mendicant understands:  ‘When this exists, this comes to be; due to the arising of this, this arises.  When this doesn’t exist, this doesn’t come to be; due to the cessation of this, this ceases. That is:  ignorance is a requirement for choices.  Choices are a requirement for consciousness.  Consciousness is a requirement for name and form.  Name and form are requirements for the six sense fields.  The six sense fields are requirements for contact.  Contact is",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 116  At Isigili  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Isigili Mountain.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, do you see that Mount Vebhāra?”  “Yes, sir.”  “It used to have a different label and description.  Do you see that Mount Paṇḍava?”  “Yes, sir.”  “It too used to have a different label and description.  Do you see that Mount Vepulla?”  “Yes, sir.”  “It too used to have a different label and description.  Do you see that Mount Vulture’s Peak?”  “Yes, sir.”  “It too used to have a different label and description.  Do you see that Mount Isigili?”  “Yes, sir.”  “It used to have exactly the same label and description.  Once upon a time, five hundred Independent Buddhas dwelt for a long time on this Isigili.  They were seen entering the mountain, but after entering were seen no more.  When people noticed this they said:  ‘That mountain swallows these seers!’  That’s how it came to be known as Isigili, the “seer-swallower”.  I shall declare the names of the Independent Buddhas;  I shall extol the names of the Independent Buddhas;  I shall teach the names of the Independent Buddhas.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “The independent Buddhas who dwelt for a long time on this Isigili were named Ariṭṭha,  Upariṭṭha,  Tagarasikhī,  Yasassin,  Sudassana,  Piyadassin,  Gandhāra,  Piṇḍola,  Upāsabha,  Nīta,  Tatha,  Sutavā,  and Bhāvitatta.  Those saintly beings, untroubled, <j>with no need for hope,  who each achieved awakening independently;  hear me extol their names,  the supreme men, free of thorns.  Ariṭṭha, Upariṭṭha, Tagarasikhī, Yasassin,  Sudassana, and Piyadassin the awakened;  Gandhāra, Piṇḍola, and Upāsabha,  Nīta, Tatha, Sutavā, and Bhāvitatta.  Sumbha, Subha, Methula, and Aṭṭhama,  then Assumegha, Anīgha, and Sudāṭha,  Independent Buddhas, enders of the leash to existence;  and Hiṅgū and Hiṅga the mighty.  Two sages named Jāli, and Aṭṭhaka;  then the awakened one Kosala, then Subāhu;  Upanemi, Nemi, and Santacitta,  right and true, stainless and astute.  Kāḷa and Upakāḷa, Vijita and Jita,  Aṅga and Paṅga, and Guttijita too;  Passin gave up attachment, suffering’s root,  while Aparājita defeated Māra’s power.  Satthar, Pavattar, Sarabhaṅga, Lomahaṁsa,  Uccaṅgamāya, Asita, Anāsava,  Manomaya, and Bandhumā the cutter of conceit,  then Adhimutta, and Ketumā the immaculate.  Ketumbharāga, Mātaṅga, and Ariya,  then Accuta, Accutagāma, and Byāmaka,  Sumaṅgala, Dabbila, Supatiṭṭhita,  Asayha, Khemābhirata, and Sorata.  Durannaya, Saṅgha, and also Ujjaya,  another sage, Sayha of peerless effort.  There are twelve Ānandas, Nandas, and Upanandas,  and Bhāradvāja, bearing his final body.  Bodhi, Mahānāma, and also Uttara,  Kesī, Sikhī, Sundara, and Bhāradvāja,  Tissa and Upatissa, <j>who’ve both cut the bonds to rebirth,  Upasīdarī and Sīdarī, who’ve both cut off craving.  Maṅgala was awakened, free of greed,  Usabha cut the net, the root of suffering,  Upanīta who attained the state of peace,  Uposatha, Sundara, and Saccanāma.  Jeta, Jayanta, Paduma, and Uppala;  Padumuttara, Rakkhita, and Pabbata,  Mānatthaddha, beautiful and free of greed,  and the Buddha Kaṇha, his mind well freed.  These and other mighty ones <j>awakened independently,  enders of the leash to existence— honor these great seers <j>who have slipped all chains,  fully quenched, limitless.” ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 117  The Great Forty  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I will teach you noble right immersion with its vital conditions and its prerequisites.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “And what is noble right immersion with its vital conditions and its prerequisites?  They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness.  Unification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites  is what is called noble right immersion ‘with its vital conditions’ and also ‘with its prerequisites’.  In this context, right view comes first.  And how does right view come first?  When you understand wrong view as wrong view and right view as right view, that’s your right view.  And what is wrong view?  ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’  This is wrong view.  And what is right view?  Right view is twofold, I say.  There is right view that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments.  And there is right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.  And what is right view that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments?  ‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’  This is right view that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments.  And what is right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?  It’s the wisdom—the faculty of wisdom, the power of wisdom, the awakening factor of investigation of principles, and right view as a factor of the path—in one intent on the noble, intent on the undefiled, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.  This is called right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.  They make an effort to give up wrong view and embrace right view: that’s their right effort.  Mindfully they give up wrong view and take up right view: that’s their right mindfulness.  So these three things keep running and circling around right view, namely: right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.  In this context, right view comes first.  And how does right view come first?  When you understand wrong thought as wrong thought and right thought as right thought, that’s your right view.  And what is wrong thought?  Thoughts of sensuality, of malice, and of cruelty.  This is wrong thought.  And what is right thought?  Right thought is twofold, I say.  There is right thought that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments.  And there is right thought that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.  And what is right thought that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments?  Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness.  This is right thought that is accompanied by defilements.  And what is right thought that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?  It’s the thinking—the placing of the mind, thought, planting, implanting, embedding of the mind, verbal process—in one intent on the noble, intent on the undefiled, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.  This is right thought that is noble.  They make an effort to give up wrong thought and embrace right thought: that’s their right effort.  Mindfully they give up wrong thought and take up right thought: that’s their right mindfulness.  So these three things keep running and circling around right thought, namely: right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.  In this context, right view comes first.  And how does right view come first?  When you understand wrong speech as wrong speech and right speech as right speech, that’s your right view.  And what is wrong speech?  Speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical.  This is wrong speech.  And what is right speech?  Right speech is twofold, I say.  There is right speech that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments.  And there is right speech that is noble, un",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 118  Mindfulness of Breathing  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, together with several well-known senior disciples, such as  the venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahākappina, Mahācunda, Anuruddha, Revata, Ānanda, and others.  Now at that time the senior mendicants were advising and instructing the junior mendicants.  Some senior mendicants instructed ten mendicants, while some instructed twenty, thirty, or forty.  Being instructed by the senior mendicants, the junior mendicants realized a higher distinction than they had before.  Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by a Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish.  Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed them:  “I am satisfied, mendicants, with this practice.  My heart is satisfied with this practice.  So you should rouse up even more energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.  I will wait here in Sāvatthī for the Komudī full moon of the fourth month.”  Mendicants from around the country heard about this,  and came down to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.  And those senior mendicants instructed the junior mendicants even more.  Some senior mendicants instructed ten mendicants, while some instructed twenty, thirty, or forty.  Being instructed by the senior mendicants, the junior mendicants realized a higher distinction than they had before.  Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudī full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth month—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by a Saṅgha of monks.  Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed them:  “This assembly has no chaff, mendicants, it is free of chaff, pure, and consolidated in the core.  Such is this Saṅgha of mendicants, such is this assembly!  An assembly such as this is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.  Such is this Saṅgha of mendicants, such is this assembly!  For an assembly such as this, giving little becomes much, while giving much becomes even more.  Such is this Saṅgha of mendicants, such is this assembly!  An assembly such as this is rarely seen in the world.  Such is this Saṅgha of mendicants, such is this assembly!  An assembly such as this is worth traveling many leagues to see, even if you have to carry your own provisions in a knapsack.  For in this Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their heart’s goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.  There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha.  In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who, with the ending of the five lower fetters are reborn spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.  There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha.  In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.  There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha.  In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, destined for awakening.  There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha.  In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who are committed to developing the four kinds of mindfulness meditation …  the four right efforts …  the four bases of psychic power …  the five faculties …  the five powers …  the seven awakening factors …  the noble eightfold path.  There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha.  In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who are committed to developing the meditation on love …  compassion …  rejoicing …  equanimity …  ugliness …  impermanence.  There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha.  In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who are committed to developing the meditation on mindfulness of breathing.  Mendicants, when mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial.  Mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.  The four kinds of mindfulness meditation, when developed and cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors.  And the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom.  And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?  It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, o",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 119  Mindfulness of the Body  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them.  “It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing,  how the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has said that mindfulness of the body, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial.”  But their conversation was left unfinished. Then the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat on the seat spread out  and addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said:  “And how, mendicants, is mindfulness of the body developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?  It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence.  Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.  Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’  When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’  They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’  As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  That’s how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.  Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know ‘I am walking’. When standing they know ‘I am standing’. When sitting they know ‘I am sitting’. And when lying down they know ‘I am lying down’.  Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.  As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.  Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.  As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.  Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.  ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’  It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as  fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice.  And a person with clear eyes were to open it and examine the contents:  ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’  In the same way, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. …  As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.  Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.  That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.  Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements:  ‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’  It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into chops.  In the same way, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements:  ‘In this body there is the earth element, the water eleme",

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “I shall teach you rebirth by choice.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.  They think:  ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats!’  They settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it.  Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there.  This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.  Furthermore, take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.  They think:  ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do brahmins …  well-to-do householders.’  They settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it.  Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there.  This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.  Furthermore, take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.  And they’ve heard:  ‘The gods of the four great kings are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.’  They think:  ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of the gods of the four great kings!’  They settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it.  Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there.  This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.  Furthermore, take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.  And they’ve heard:  ‘The gods of the thirty-three …  the gods of Yama …  the joyful gods …  the gods who love to create …  the gods who control what is created by others are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.’  They think:  ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of the gods who control what is created by others!’  They settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it.  Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there.  This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.  Furthermore, take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.  And they’ve heard:  ‘The Divinity of a thousand is long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.’  Now the Divinity of a thousand meditates focused on pervading a thousandfold galaxy,  as well as the sentient beings reborn there.  As a person with clear eyes might pick up a gallnut in their hand and examine it,  so too the Divinity of a thousand meditates focused on pervading a thousandfold galaxy,  as well as the sentient beings reborn there.  They think:  ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of the Divinity of a thousand!’  They settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it.  Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there.  This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.  Furthermore, take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.  And they’ve heard:  ‘The Divinity of two thousand …  the Divinity of three thousand …  the Divinity of four thousand …  the Divinity of five thousand is long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.’  Now the Divinity of five thousand meditates focused on pervading a five-thousandfold galaxy,  as well as the sentient beings reborn there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.  And they’ve heard:  ‘The Divinity of ten thousand is long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.’  Now the Divinity of ten thousand meditates focused on pervading a ten-thousandfold galaxy,  as well as the sentient beings reborn there.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 121  The Shorter Discourse on Emptiness  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.  Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:  “Sir, this one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Townsville.  There I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘Ānanda, these days I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.’  I trust I properly heard, learned, applied the mind, and remembered that from the Buddha?”  “Indeed, Ānanda, you properly heard, learned, applied the mind, and remembered that.  Now, as before, I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.  Consider this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. It’s empty of elephants, cows, horses, and mares; of gold and silver; and of gatherings of men and women.  There is only this that is not emptiness, namely, the oneness dependent on the mendicant Saṅgha.  In the same way, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of the village and the perception of people—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.  Their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided in that perception of wilderness.  They understand:  ‘Here there is no stress due to the perception of village or the perception of people.  There is only this modicum of stress, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.’  They understand: ‘This field of perception is empty of the perception of the village. It is empty of the perception of people.  There is only this that is not emptiness, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.’  And so they regard it as empty of what is not there, but as to what remains they understand that it is present.  That’s how emptiness manifests in them—genuine, undistorted, and pure.  Furthermore, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of people and the perception of wilderness—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of earth.  Their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided in that perception of earth.  As a bull’s hide is rid of folds when fully stretched out by a hundred pegs,  so too, ignoring the hilly terrain, inaccessible riverlands, stumps and thorns, and rugged mountains, they focus on the oneness dependent on the perception of earth.  Their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided in that perception of earth.  They understand:  ‘Here there is no stress due to the perception of people or the perception of wilderness.  There is only this modicum of stress, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of earth.’  They understand: ‘This field of perception is empty of the perception of people. It is empty of the perception of wilderness.  There is only this that is not emptiness, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of earth.’  And so they regard it as empty of what is not there, but as to what remains they understand that it is present.  That’s how emptiness manifests in them—genuine, undistorted, and pure.  Furthermore, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of wilderness and the perception of earth—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of the dimension of infinite space.  Their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided in that perception of the dimension of infinite space.  They understand:  ‘Here there is no stress due to the perception of wilderness or the perception of earth.  There is only this modicum of stress, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of the dimension of infinite space.’  They understand: ‘This field of perception is empty of the perception of wilderness. It is empty of the perception of earth.

That’s how emptiness manifests in them—genuine, undistorted, and pure.  Furthermore, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of earth and the perception of the dimension of infinite space—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness.  Their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided in that perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 122  The Longer Discourse on Emptiness  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms.  He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the lodge of the Sakyan Khemaka the Dark for the day’s meditation.  Now at that time many resting places had been spread out at the lodge of Khemaka the Dark.  The Buddha saw this,  and wondered,  “Many resting places have been spread out;  are there many mendicants living here?”  Now at that time Venerable Ānanda, together with many other mendicants, was making robes at the lodge of the Sakyan Ghaṭā.  Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ghaṭā’s lodge, where he sat on the seat spread out  and said to Venerable Ānanda,  “Many resting places have been spread out at the lodge of Khemaka the Dark;  are many mendicants living there?”  “Indeed there are, sir.  It’s currently the time for making robes.”  “Ānanda, a mendicant doesn’t shine who enjoys company and groups, who loves them and likes to enjoy them.  It is quite impossible that such a mendicant will get the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty.  But you should expect that a mendicant who lives alone, withdrawn from the group, will get the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is possible.  Indeed, Ānanda, it is quite impossible that a mendicant who enjoys company will enter and remain in the freedom of heart—either that which is temporary and pleasant, or that which is irreversible and unshakable.  But it is possible that a mendicant who lives alone, withdrawn from the group will enter and remain in the freedom of heart—either that which is temporary and pleasant, or that which is irreversible and unshakable.  Ānanda, I do not see even a single sight which, with its decay and perishing, would not give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in someone who has desire and lust for it.  But this meditation has been understood by the Realized One, namely  to enter and remain in emptiness internally by not focusing on any signs.  Now, suppose that while the Realized One is practicing this meditation, monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, rulers and their chief ministers, monastics of other religions and their disciples go to visit him.  In that case, with a mind slanting, sloping, and inclining to seclusion, withdrawn, and loving renunciation, having totally eliminated defiling influences, he invariably gives a talk concerned only with sending them away.  Therefore, if a mendicant should wish,  ‘May I enter and remain in emptiness internally!’ then they should still, settle, unify, and immerse their mind in samādhi internally.  And how does a mendicant still, settle, unify, and immerse their mind in samādhi internally?  It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption …  second absorption …  third absorption …  fourth absorption.  That’s how a mendicant stills, settles, unifies, and immerses their mind in samādhi internally.  They focus on emptiness internally,  but their mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided.  In that case, they understand:  ‘I am focusing on emptiness internally, but my mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided.’  In this way they are aware of the situation.  They focus on emptiness externally …  They focus on emptiness internally and externally …  They focus on the imperturbable,  but their mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided.  In that case, they understand:  ‘I am focusing on the imperturbable internally, but my mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided.’  In this way they are aware of the situation.  Then that mendicant should still, settle, unify, and immerse their mind in samādhi internally using the same meditation subject as a basis of immersion that they used before.  They focus on emptiness internally,  and their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided.  In that case, they understand:  ‘I am focusing on emptiness internally, and my mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided.’  In this way they are aware of the situation.  They focus on emptiness externally …  They focus on emptiness internally and externally …  They focus on the imperturbable,  and their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 123  Incredible and Amazing  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them:  “It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!  For he is able to know the Buddhas of the past who have become completely quenched, cut off proliferation, cut off the course, finished off the cycle, and passed beyond all suffering.  He knows their birth, names, clans, conduct, teaching, wisdom, meditation, and freedom.”  When they said this, Venerable Ānanda said,  “The Realized Ones are incredible, reverends, and they have incredible qualities.  They’re amazing, and they have amazing qualities.”  But this conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished.  Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out,  and addressed the mendicants:  “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”  So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said,  “Well then, Ānanda, say some more about the incredible and amazing qualities of the Realized One.”  “Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘Mindful and aware, the being intent on awakening was reborn in the host of joyful gods.’  This I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.  I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘Mindful and aware, the being intent on awakening remained in the host of joyful gods.’  This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.  I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘For the whole of that life, the being intent on awakening remained in the host of joyful gods.’  This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.  I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘Mindful and aware, the being intent on awakening passed away from the host of joyful gods and was conceived in his mother’s womb.’  This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.  I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘When the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of joyful gods, he is conceived in his mother’s womb.  And then—in this world with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.  Even in the boundless gloom of interstellar space—so utterly dark that even the luminosity of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful, makes no impression—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.  And even the sentient beings reborn there recognize each other by that light: “So, it seems other sentient beings have been reborn here!”  And this ten-thousandfold galaxy shakes and rocks and trembles. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appears in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods.’  This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.  I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘When the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, four godlings approach to guard the four quarters, so that no human or non-human or anyone at all shall harm the being intent on awakening or his mother.’  This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.  I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘When the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she becomes naturally ethical. She refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.’  This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.  I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘When the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she no longer thinks of men in a sexual way, and she cannot be violated by a man of lustful intent.’  This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.  I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘When the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she obtains the five kinds of sensual stimulation and amuses herself, supplied and provided with them.’  This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.  I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:  ‘When the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, no afflictions beset her. She’s happy and free of bodily fatigue. And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb, whole in his major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.  Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally lustrous, eight-faceted, well-worked. And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.  And a person with clear eyes were to take it in their hand and examin",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 124  With Bakkula  So I have heard.  At one time Venerable Bakkula was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Then the naked ascetic Kassapa, an old friend of Bakkula in the lay life, approached him, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Venerable Bakkula,  “Reverend Bakkula, how long has it been since you went forth?”  “It has been eighty years, reverend.”  “But in these eighty years, how many times have you had sex?”  “You shouldn’t ask me such a question.  Rather, you should ask me this:  ‘But in these eighty years, how many times have sensual perceptions ever arisen in you?’”  “But in these eighty years, how many times have sensual perceptions ever arisen in you?”  “In these eighty years, I don’t recall that any sensual perception has ever arisen in me.”  This we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula.  “In these eighty years, I don’t recall that any perception of ill will …  or cruelty has ever arisen in me.”  This too we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula.  “In these eighty years, I don’t recall that any thought of sensuality …  ill will …  or cruelty has ever arisen in me.”  This too we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula.  “In these eighty years, I don’t recall accepting a robe from a householder …  cutting a robe with a knife …  sewing a robe with a needle …  dying a robe …  sewing a robe during the robe-making ceremony …  wandering to look for robe material for my companions in the spiritual life when they are making robes …  accepting an invitation …  having such a thought:  ‘If only someone would invite me!’ …  sitting down inside a house …  eating inside a house …  getting caught up in the features by way of the details of a lady’s appearance …  teaching a lady, even so much as a four line verse …  going to the nuns’ quarters …  teaching the nuns …  teaching the trainee nuns …  teaching the novice nuns …  giving the going forth …  giving the ordination …  giving dependence …  being looked after by a novice …  bathing in the sauna …  bathing with bath powder …  looking for a massage from my companions in the spiritual life …  being ill, even for as long as it takes to pull a cow’s udder …  being presented with medicine, even as much as a bit of yellow myrobalan …  leaning on a leaning-board …  preparing a cot …”  This too we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula.  “In these eighty years, I don’t recall commencing the rainy season residence within a village.”  This too we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula.  “Reverend, for seven days I ate the nation’s almsfood as a debtor.  Then on the eighth day I became enlightened.”  This too we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula.  “Reverend Bakkula, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training?”  And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training.  Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.  He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”  And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.  Then some time later Venerable Bakkula, taking a latchkey, went from dwelling to dwelling, saying,  “Come forth, venerables, come forth! Today will be my full extinguishment.”  This too we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula.  And Venerable Bakkula became fully extinguished while seated right in the middle of the Saṅgha.  This too we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula. ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 125  The Level of the Tamed  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Now at that time the novice Aciravata was staying in a wilderness hut.  Then as Prince Jayasena was going for a walk he approached Aciravata, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Aciravata,  “Worthy Aggivessana, I have heard that  a mendicant who meditates diligently, keenly, and resolutely can experience unification of mind.”  “That’s so true, Prince! That’s so true!  A mendicant who meditates diligently, keenly, and resolutely can experience unification of mind.”  “Worthy Aggivessana, please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized it.”  “I’m not competent to do so, Prince.  For if I were to teach you the Dhamma as I have learned and memorized it, you might not understand the meaning, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.”  “Worthy Aggivessana, please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized it.  Hopefully I will understand the meaning of what you say.”  “I shall teach you.  If you understand the meaning of what I say, that’s good.  If not, then leave each to his own, and do not question me about it further.”  “Worthy Aggivessana, please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized it.  If I understand the meaning of what you say, that’s good.  If not, then I will leave each to his own, and not question you about it further.”  Then the novice Aciravata taught Prince Jayasena the Dhamma as he had learned and memorized it.  When he had spoken, Jayasena said to him,  “It is impossible, worthy Aggivessana, it cannot happen that a mendicant who meditates diligently, keenly, and resolutely can experience unification of mind.”  Having declared that this was impossible, Jayasena got up from his seat and left.  Not long after he had left, Aciravata went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,  and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.  When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,  “How could it possibly be otherwise, Aggivessana?  Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more. It’s simply impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known, seen, and realized by renunciation.  Suppose there was a pair of elephants or horse or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained. And there was a pair who were not tamed or trained.  What do you think, Aggivessana?  Wouldn’t the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed?”  “Yes, sir.”  “But would the pair that was not tamed and trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed, just like the tamed pair?”  “No, sir.”  “In the same way, Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more. It’s simply impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known, seen, and realized by renunciation.  Suppose there was a big mountain not far from a town or village.  And two friends set out from that village or town, lending each other a hand up to the mountain. Once there, one friend would remain at the foot of the mountain, while the other would climb to the peak.  The one standing at the foot would say to the one at the peak,  ‘My friend, what do you see, standing there at the peak?’  They’d reply,  ‘Standing at the peak, I see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds!’  But the other would say,  ‘It’s impossible, it cannot happen that, standing at the peak, you can see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds.’  So their friend would come down from the peak, take their friend by the arm, and make them climb to the peak. After giving them a while to catch their breath, they’d say,  ‘My friend, what do you see, standing here at the peak?’  They’d reply,  ‘Standing at the peak, I see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds!’  They’d say,  ‘Just now I understood you to say:  “It’s impossible, it cannot happen that, standing at the peak, you can see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds.”  But now you say:  “Standing at the peak, I see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds!”’  They’d say,  ‘But my friend, it was because I was obstructed by this big mountain that I didn’t see what could be seen.’  But bigger than that is the mass of ignorance by which Prince Jayasena is veiled, shrouded, covered, and engulfed.  Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more. It is quite impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known, seen, and realized by renunciation.  It would be no w",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 126  With Bhūmija  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Then Venerable Bhūmija robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Prince Jayasena, where he sat on the seat spread out.  Then Jayasena approached and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Bhūmija:  “Worthy Bhūmija, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:  ‘If you make a wish and lead the spiritual life, you can’t win the fruit.  If you don’t make a wish and lead the spiritual life, you can’t win the fruit.  If you both make a wish and don’t make a wish and lead the spiritual life, you can’t win the fruit.  If you neither make a wish nor don’t make a wish and lead the spiritual life, you can’t win the fruit.’  What does the worthy Bhūmija’s Teacher say about this? How does he explain it?”  “Prince, I haven’t heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha.  But it’s possible that he might explain it like this:  ‘If you lead the spiritual life irrationally, you can’t win the fruit, regardless of whether you make a wish,  you don’t make a wish,  you both do and do not make a wish,  or you neither do nor don’t make a wish.  But if you lead the spiritual life rationally, you can win the fruit, regardless of whether you make a wish,  you don’t make a wish,  you both do and do not make a wish,  or you neither do nor don’t make a wish.’  I haven’t heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha.  But it’s possible that he might explain it like that.”  “If that’s what your teacher says, worthy Bhūmija, he clearly stands head and shoulders above all the various other ascetics and brahmins.”  Then Prince Jayasena served Venerable Bhūmija from his own dish.  Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, Bhūmija went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him all that had happened, adding:  “Answering this way, I trust that I repeated what the Buddha has said, and didn’t misrepresent him with an untruth. I trust my explanation was in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuttal or criticism.”  “Indeed, Bhūmija, in answering this way you repeated what I’ve said, and didn’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation was in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuttal or criticism.  There are some ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion. If they lead the spiritual life, they can’t win the fruit, regardless of whether they make a wish,  they don’t make a wish,  they both do and do not make a wish,  or they neither do nor don’t make a wish.  Why is that?  Because that’s an irrational way to win the fruit.  Suppose there was a person in need of oil. While wandering in search of oil, they tried heaping sand in a bucket, sprinkling it thoroughly with water, and pressing it out.  But by doing this, they couldn’t extract any oil, regardless of whether they made a wish,  didn’t make a wish,  both did and did not make a wish,  or neither did nor did not make a wish.  Why is that?  Because that’s an irrational way to extract oil.  And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion. If they lead the spiritual life, they can’t win the fruit, regardless of whether or not they make a wish.  Why is that?  Because that’s an irrational way to win the fruit.  Suppose there was a person in need of milk. While wandering in search of milk, they tried pulling the horn of a newly-calved cow.  But by doing this, they couldn’t get any milk, regardless of whether they made a wish,  didn’t make a wish,  both did and did not make a wish,  or neither did nor did not make a wish.  Why is that?  Because that’s an irrational way to get milk.  And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view …  Because that’s an irrational way to win the fruit.  Suppose there was a person in need of butter. While wandering in search of butter, they tried pouring water into a pot and churning it with a stick.  But by doing this, they couldn’t produce any butter, regardless of whether they made a wish,  didn’t make a wish,  both did and did not make a wish,  or neither did nor did not make a wish.  Why is that?  Because that’s an irrational way to produce butter.  And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view …  Because that’s an irrational way to win the fruit.  Suppose there was a person in need of fire. While wandering in search of fire, they tried drilling a green, sappy log with a drill-stick.  But by doing this, they couldn’t start a fire, regardless of whether they made a wish,  didn’t make a wish,  both ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 127  With Anuruddha  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  And then the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga addressed a man,  “Please, worthy man, go to Venerable Anuruddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him,  ‘Sir, the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga bows with his head to your feet.’  And then ask him whether he  might please accept tomorrow’s meal from Pañcakaṅga together with the mendicant Saṅgha.  And ask whether he might please come earlier than usual,  for Pañcakaṅga has many duties, and much work to do for the king.”  “Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Pañcakaṅga asked, and  Venerable Anuruddha consented with silence.  Then when the night had passed, Anuruddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Pañcakaṅga’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out.  Then Pañcakaṅga served and satisfied Anuruddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.  When Anuruddha had eaten and washed his hands and bowl, Pañcakaṅga took a low seat, sat to one side,  and said to him:  “Sir, some senior mendicants have come to me and said,  ‘Householder, develop the limitless release of heart.’  Others have said,  ‘Householder, develop the expansive release of heart.’  Now, the limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart:  do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?”  “Well then, householder, let me know what you think about this. Afterwards you’ll get it without fail.”  “Sir, this is what I think.  The limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.”  “The limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart differ in both meaning and phrasing.  This is a way to understand how these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.  And what is the limitless release of the heart?  It’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.  They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …  They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …  They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.  This is called the limitless release of the heart.  And what is the expansive release of the heart?  It’s when a mendicant meditates focused on pervading the extent of a single tree root as expansive.  This is called the expansive release of the heart.  Also, a mendicant meditates focused on pervading the extent of two or three tree roots …  a single village district …  two or three village districts …  a single kingdom …  two or three kingdoms …  this land surrounded by ocean.  This too is called the expansive release of the heart.  This is a way to understand how these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.  Householder, there are these four kinds of rebirth in a future life.  What four?  Take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘limited radiance’.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of limited radiance.  Next, take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘limitless radiance’.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of limitless radiance.  Next, take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘corrupted radiance’.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of corrupted radiance.  Next, take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘pure radiance’.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of pure radiance.  These are the four kinds of rebirth in a future life.  There comes a time, householder, when the deities gather together as one. When they do so, a difference in their color is evident, but not in their radiance.  It’s like when a person brings several oil lamps into one house.  You can detect a difference in their flames, but not in their radiance.  In the same way, when the deities gather together as one, a difference in their color is evident, but not in their radiance.  There comes a time when those deities go their separate ways. When they do so, a difference both in their color and also in their radiance is evident.  It’s like when a person takes those several oil lamps out of that house.  You can detect a difference both in their flames and also in their radiance.  In the same way, when the deities go their separate way",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 128  Corruptions  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.  Now at that time the mendicants of Kosambī were fighting, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words.  Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him what was happening, adding:  “Please, sir go to those mendicants out of sympathy.”  The Buddha consented with silence.  Then the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said,  “Enough, mendicants! Stop fighting, quarreling, and disputing.”  When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,  “Wait, sir!  Let the Buddha, the Lord of the Dhamma,  remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life.  We will be known for this fighting, quarreling, arguing, and disputing.”  For a second time …  and a third time the Buddha said to those mendicants,  “Enough, mendicants! Stop fighting, quarreling, and disputing.”  For a third time that mendicant said to the Buddha,  “Wait, sir!  Let the Buddha, the Lord of the Dhamma,  remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life.  We will be known for this fighting, quarreling, arguing, and disputing.”  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms.  After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order. Taking his bowl and robe, he recited these verses while standing right there:  “Many voices shout at once,  yet no-one thinks that they’re the fool.  Even as the Saṅgha splits,  they think no better of the other.  Dolts pretending to be astute,  they talk, their words out of bounds.  They blab at will, their mouths agape,  and not one knows what leads them on.  ‘They abused me, they hit me!  They beat me, they robbed me!’  For those bearing such a grudge,  hatred is never laid to rest.  ‘They abused me, they hit me!  They beat me, they robbed me!’  For those who bear no such grudge,  hatred is laid to rest.  For never is hatred  laid to rest by hate,  it’s laid to rest by love:  this is an ancient teaching.  When others do not understand,  let us, who do understand this,  restrain ourselves in this regard;  for that is how conflicts are laid to rest.  Breakers of bones and takers of life,  thieves of cattle, horses, wealth,  those who plunder the nation:  even they can come together,  so why can’t you?  If you find an alert companion,  an attentive friend to live happily together,  then, overcoming all adversities,  wander with them, joyful and mindful.  If you find no alert companion,  no attentive friend to live happily together,  then, like a king who flees his conquered realm,  wander alone like a tusker in the wilds.  It’s better to wander alone,  there’s no fellowship with fools.  Wander alone and do no wrong,  at ease like a tusker in the wilds.”  After speaking these verses while standing, the Buddha went to the village of the child salt-miners,  where Venerable Bhagu was staying at the time.  Bhagu saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,  so he spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,  and washed his feet.  Bhagu bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.  The Buddha said to him,  “I hope you’re keeping well, mendicant; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”  “I’m keeping well, Blessed One; I’m all right. And I’m having no trouble getting almsfood.”  Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Bhagu with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and set out for the Park of the East-Raftered Hall.  Now at that time the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were staying in the Park of the East-Raftered Hall.  The park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distance  and said to the Buddha,  “Don’t come into this park, ascetic.  There are three gentlemen staying here whose nature is to desire only the self.  Don’t disturb them.”  Anuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddha,  and said to him,  “Don’t keep the Buddha out, good park keeper!  Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.”  Then Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila, and said to them,  “Come forth, venerables, come forth! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived!”  Then Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila came out to greet the Buddha.  One received his bowl and robe, one spread out a seat, and one set out water for washing his feet.  The Buddha sat on the seat spread out  and washed his feet.  Those venerables bowed and sat down to one side.  The Buddha said to Anuruddha,  “I hope you’re keeping well, Anuruddha and friends; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”  “We’re keeping well, Blessed One; we’re all right. And we’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”  “I hope you’re living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each oth",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 129  The Foolish and the Astute  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “These are the three characteristics, signs, and manifestations of a fool.  What three?  A fool thinks poorly, speaks poorly, and acts poorly.  If a fool didn’t think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly, then how would the astute know of them,  ‘This worthy one is a fool, an untrue person’?  But since a fool does think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly, then the astute do know of them,  ‘This worthy one is a fool, an untrue person’.  A fool experiences three kinds of suffering and sadness in this very life.  Suppose a fool is sitting in a council hall, a street, or a crossroad,  where people are discussing what is proper and fitting.  And suppose that fool is someone who kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, lies, and consumes beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.  Then that fool thinks,  ‘These people are discussing what is proper and fitting.  But those bad things are found in me and I exhibit them!’  This is the first kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life.  Furthermore, a fool sees that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments— whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the hounds, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.  Then that fool thinks,  ‘The kinds of deeds for which the kings inflict such punishments— those things are found in me and I exhibit them!  If the kings find out about me, they will inflict the same kinds of punishments on me!’  This is the second kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life.  Furthermore, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.  It is like the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening as it settles down, rests down, and lays down upon the earth.  In the same way, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.  Then that fool thinks,  ‘Alas, I haven’t done good and skillful things that keep me safe.  And I have done bad things, violence and sin.  When I depart, I’ll go to the place where people who’ve done such things go.’  They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breasts and falling into confusion.  This is the third kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life.  Having done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.  And if there’s anything of which it may be rightly said that  it is utterly unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable, it is of hell that this should be said.  So much so that it’s not easy to give a simile for how painful hell is.”  When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,  “But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”  “It’s possible,” said the Buddha.  “Suppose they arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying,  ‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’  The king would say,  ‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spears!’  The king’s men did as they were told.  Then at midday the king would say,  ‘My men, how is that man?’  ‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’  The king would say,  ‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the midday with a hundred spears!’  The king’s men did as they were told.  Then late in the afternoon the king would say,  ‘My men, how is that man?’  ‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’  The king would say,  ‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spears!’  The king’s men did as they were told.  What do you think, mendicants?  Would that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spears?”  “Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear, let alone three hundred spears!”  Then the Buddha, picking up a stone the size of his palm, addressed the mendicants,  “What do you think, mendicants?  Which is bigger: the stone the size of my palm that I’ve picked up, or the Himalayas, the king of mountains?”  “Sir, the stone you’ve picked up is tiny. Compared to the Himalayas, it doesn’t count, it’s not worth a ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 130  Messengers of the Gods  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, suppose there were two houses with doors. A person with clear eyes standing in between them would see humans entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro.  In the same way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, or among humans. These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the ghost realm, the animal realm, or in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’  The wardens of hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama, saying,  ‘Your Majesty, this person did not pay due respect to their mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, or honor the elders in the family.  May Your Majesty punish them!’  King Yama pursues, presses, and grills them about the first messenger of the gods.  ‘Worthy man, did you not see the first messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’  He says,  ‘I saw nothing, sir.’  King Yama says to them,  ‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings a little baby collapsed in their own urine and feces?’  He says,  ‘I saw that, sir.’  King Yama says to them,  ‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature— “I, too, am liable to be born. I’m not exempt from rebirth. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’  He says,  ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’  King Yama says to them,  ‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.  Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.  That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’  Then King Yama grills them about the second messenger of the gods.  ‘Worthy man, did you not see the second messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’  He says,  ‘I saw nothing, sir.’  King Yama says to them,  ‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings an elderly woman or a man—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as they walk, ailing, past their prime, with teeth broken, hair grey and scanty or bald, skin wrinkled, and limbs blotchy?’  He says,  ‘I saw that, sir.’  King Yama says to them,  ‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature— “I, too, am liable to grow old. I’m not exempt from old age. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’  He says,  ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’  King Yama says to them,  ‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.  Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.  That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities.

I’m not exempt from sickness. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’  He says,  ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’  King Yama says to them,  ‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.  Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “I shall teach you the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Don’t run back to the past,  don’t anticipate the future.  What’s past is left behind,  the future has not arrived;  and any present phenomenon  you clearly discern in every case.  The unfaltering, the unshakable:  having known that, foster it.  Today’s the day to keenly work— who knows, tomorrow may bring death!  For there is no bargain to be struck  with Death and his mighty horde.  One who keenly meditates like this,  tireless all night and day:  that’s who has one fine night— so declares the peaceful sage.  And how do you run back to the past?  You muster delight there, thinking: ‘I had such form in the past.’ … ‘I had such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the past.’  That’s how you run back to the past.  And how do you not run back to the past?  You don’t muster delight there, thinking: ‘I had such form in the past.’ … ‘I had such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the past.’  That’s how you don’t run back to the past.  And how do you anticipate the future?  You muster delight there, thinking: ‘May I have such form in the future.’ … ‘May I have such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the future.’  That’s how you anticipate the future.  And how do you not anticipate the future?  You don’t muster delight there, thinking: ‘May I have such form in the future.’ … ‘May I have such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the future.’  That’s how you don’t anticipate the future.  And how do you falter amid presently arisen phenomena?  It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.  They regard feeling …  perception …  choices …  consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.  That’s how you falter amid presently arisen phenomena.  And how do you not falter amid presently arisen phenomena?  It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.  They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.  They don’t regard feeling …  perception …  choices …  consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.  That’s how you don’t falter amid presently arisen phenomena.  ‘Don’t run back to the past,  don’t anticipate the future.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 132  Ānanda and One Fine Night  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.  Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out,  and addressed the mendicants,  “Who was inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”  “It was Venerable Ānanda, sir.”  Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,  “But in what way were you inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”  “I was doing so in this way, sir,” replied Ānanda.  “Don’t run back to the past,  don’t anticipate the future.  What’s past is left behind,  the future has not arrived;  and any present phenomenon  you clearly discern in every case.  The unfaltering, the unshakable:  having known that, foster it.  Today’s the day to keenly work— who knows, tomorrow may bring death!  For there is no bargain to be struck  with Death and his mighty horde.  One who keenly meditates like this,  tireless all night and day:  that’s who has one fine night— so declares the peaceful sage.  And how do you run back to the past? …  And how do you not run back to the past? …  And how do you anticipate the future? …  And how do you not anticipate the future? …  And how do you falter amid presently arisen phenomena? …  And how do you not falter amid presently arisen phenomena? …  That’s how you don’t falter amid presently arisen phenomena.  ‘Don’t run back to the past,  don’t anticipate the future. …  that’s who has one fine night— so declares the peaceful sage.’  That’s how I was inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.”  “Good, good, Ānanda.  It’s good that you were inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.”  And the Buddha repeated the verses and analysis once more.  That is what the Buddha said.  Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said. ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 133  Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery.  Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe.  When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs.  Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot springs, went up to Samiddhi, stood to one side, and said to Samiddhi:  “Mendicant, do you remember the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”  “No, reverend, I do not.  Do you?”  “I also do not.  But do you remember just the verses on the one who has one fine night?”  “I do not.  Do you?”  “I also do not.  Learn the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night, mendicant,  memorize it,  and remember it.  It is beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”  That’s what that deity said,  before vanishing right there.  Then, when the night had passed, Samiddhi went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added:  “Sir, please teach me the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.”  “Well then, mendicant, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” Samiddhi replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Don’t run back to the past,  don’t anticipate the future.  What’s past is left behind,  the future has not arrived;  and any present phenomenon  you clearly discern in every case.  The unfaltering, the unshakable:  having known that, foster it.  Today’s the day to keenly work— who knows, tomorrow may bring death!  For there is no bargain to be struck  with Death and his mighty horde.  One who keenly meditates like this,  tireless all night and day:  that’s who has one fine night— so declares the peaceful sage.”  That is what the Buddha said.  When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.  Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,  “The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. …  Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary given by the Buddha?”  Then those mendicants thought:  “This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.  He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.  Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”  Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said:  “May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.”  “Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.  Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you bypassed him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.  For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.  That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter. You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”  “Certainly he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.  That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.  We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.  Still, Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.  He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.  Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”  “Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, reverend,” they replied.  Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:  “Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:  ‘Don’t run back to the past …  that’s who has one fine night— so declares the peaceful sage.’  And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary recital.  And how do you run back to the past?  Consciousness gets tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such eyes and such sights.’  So you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you run back to the past.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 134  Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Now at that time Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.  Then, late at night, the glorious godling Candana, lighting up the entire Banyan Tree Monastery, went up to the Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, he said to Lomasakaṅgiya:  “Mendicant, do you remember the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”  “No, reverend, I do not.  Do you?”  “I also do not.  But do you remember just the verses on the one who has one fine night?”  “I do not.  Do you?”  “I do.”  “How do you remember the verses on the one who has one fine night?”  “This one time, the Buddha was staying among the gods of the thirty-three at the root of the Shady Orchid Tree on the stone spread with a cream rug.  There he taught the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night to the gods of the thirty-three:  ‘Don’t run back to the past,  don’t anticipate the future.  What’s past is left behind,  the future has not arrived;  and any present phenomenon  you clearly discern in every case.  The unfaltering, the unshakable:  having known that, foster it.  Today’s the day to keenly work— who knows, tomorrow may bring death!  For there is no bargain to be struck  with Death and his mighty horde.  One who keenly meditates like this,  tireless all night and day:  that’s who has one fine night— so declares the peaceful sage.’  That’s how I remember the verses of the one who has one fine night.  Learn the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night, mendicant,  memorize it,  and remember it.  It is beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”  That’s what the godling Candana said  before vanishing right there.  Then Lomasakaṅgiya set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī.  Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added:  “Sir, please teach me the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.”  “But mendicant, do you know that god?”  “I do not, sir.”  “That godling was named Candana.  Candana pays attention, applies the mind, concentrates wholeheartedly, and actively listens to the teaching.  Well then, mendicant, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” Lomasakaṅgiya replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Don’t run back to the past,  don’t anticipate the future.  What’s past is left behind,  the future has not arrived;  and any present phenomenon  you clearly discern in every case.  The unfaltering, the unshakable:  having known that, foster it.  Today’s the day to keenly work— who knows, tomorrow may bring death!  For there is no bargain to be struck  with Death and his mighty horde.  One who keenly meditates like this,  tireless all night and day:  that’s who has one fine night— so declares the peaceful sage.  And how do you run back to the past? … ”  That is what the Buddha said.  Satisfied, Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya approved what the Buddha said. ",

Then the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:  “What is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why even among those who are human beings some are seen to be inferior and superior?  For people are seen who are short-lived and long-lived,  sickly and healthy,  ugly and beautiful,  insignificant and illustrious,  poor and rich,  from low and eminent families,  witless and wise.  What is the reason why even among those who are human beings some are seen to be inferior and superior?”  “Student, sentient beings are the owners of their deeds and heir to their deeds. Deeds are their womb, their relative, and their refuge.  It is deeds that divide beings into  inferior and superior.”  “I don’t understand the meaning of what the worthy Gotama has said in brief, without explaining the details.  Worthy Gotama, please teach me this matter in detail so I can understand the meaning.”  “Well then, student, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, worthy sir,” replied Subha.  The Buddha said this:  “Take some woman or man who kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.  Because of undertaking such deeds, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.  If they’re not reborn in a place of loss, but return to the human realm, then wherever they’re reborn they’re short-lived.  For killing living creatures is the path leading to a short lifespan.  But take some woman or man who gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.  Because of undertaking such deeds, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.  If they’re not reborn in a heavenly realm, but return to the human realm, then wherever they’re reborn they’re long-lived.  For not killing living creatures is the path leading to a long lifespan.  Take some woman or man who habitually hurts living creatures with a fist, stone, rod, or sword.  Because of undertaking such deeds, after death they’re reborn in a place of loss …  or if they return to the human realm, they’re sickly …  But take some woman or man who would never hurt living creatures with a fist, stone, rod, or sword.  Because of undertaking such deeds, after death they’re reborn in a heavenly realm …  or if they return to the human realm, they’re healthy …  Take some woman or man who is irritable and bad-tempered.  Even when lightly criticized they lose their temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness.  Because of undertaking such deeds, after death they’re reborn in a place of loss …  or if they return to the human realm, they’re ugly …  But take some woman or man who isn’t irritable and bad-tempered.  Even when heavily criticized, they don’t lose their temper, become annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, or display annoyance, hate, and bitterness.  Because of undertaking such deeds, after death they’re reborn in a heavenly realm …  or if they return to the human realm, they’re lovely …  Take some woman or man who is jealous.  They envy, resent, and begrudge the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others.  Because of undertaking such deeds, after death they’re reborn in a place of loss …  or if they return to the human realm, they’re insignificant …  But take some woman or man who is not jealous …  Because of undertaking such deeds, after death they’re reborn in a heavenly realm …  or if they return to the human realm, they’re illustrious …  Take some woman or man who doesn’t give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.  Because of undertaking such deeds, after death they’re reborn in a place of loss …  or if they return to the human realm, they’re poor …  But take some woman or man who does give to ascetics or brahmins …  Because of undertaking such deeds, after death they’re reborn in a heavenly realm …  or if they return to the human realm, they’re rich …  Take some woman or man who is obstinate and arrogant.  They don’t bow to those they should bow to. They don’t rise up for them, offer them a seat, make way for them, or honor, respect, esteem, or venerate those who are worthy of such.  Because of undertaking such deeds, after death they’re reborn in a place of loss …  or if they return to the human realm, they’re reborn in a low class family …  But take some woman or man who is not obstinate and arrogant …  Because of undertaking suc",

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him:  “Reverend Samiddhi, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the ascetic Gotama:  ‘Deeds by way of body and speech are done in vain. Only mental deeds are real.’  And: ‘There is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at all.’”  “Don’t say that, Reverend Potaliputta, don’t say that! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say this:  ‘Deeds by way of body and speech are done in vain. Only mental deeds are real.’  But, reverend, there is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at all.”  “Reverend Samiddhi, how long has it been since you went forth?”  “Not long, reverend: three years.”  “Well now, what are we to say to the senior mendicants, when even such a junior mendicant imagines their Teacher needs defending?  After doing an intentional deed by way of body, speech, or mind, reverend, what does one feel?”  “After doing an intentional deed by way of body, speech, or mind, reverend, one feels suffering.”  Then, neither approving nor rejecting Samiddhi’s statement, Potaliputta  got up from his seat and left.  Soon after he had left, Venerable Samiddhi went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,  and informed Ānanda of all they had discussed.  When he had spoken, Ānanda said to him,  “Reverend Samiddhi, we should see the Buddha about this matter.  Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.  As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”  “Yes, reverend,” Samiddhi replied.  Then Ānanda and Samiddhi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,  and told him what had happened.  When they had spoken, the Buddha said to Ānanda,  “I don’t recall even seeing the wanderer Potaliputta, Ānanda, so how could we have had such a discussion?  The wanderer Potaliputta’s question should have been answered after analyzing it, but this futile man answered categorically.”  When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him,  “But perhaps, sir, Venerable Samiddhi spoke in reference to the statement:  ‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’”  But the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,  “See what this futile man Udāyī comes up with?  I knew that  he was coming up with something irrational.  Right from the start Potaliputta asked about the three feelings.  Suppose the futile man Samiddhi had answered the wanderer Potaliputta’s question like this:  ‘After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as pleasant by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pleasure.  After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as painful by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pain.  After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as neutral by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels neutral.’  Answering in this way, Samiddhi would have rightly answered Potaliputta.  Still, who are those foolish and incompetent wanderers of other religions to understand the Realized One’s great analysis of deeds?  If you would all listen, Ānanda, I will explain the Realized One’s great analysis of deeds.”  “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!  Let the Buddha explain the great analysis of deeds. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”  “Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Ānanda, these four individuals are found in the world.  What four?  It’s when an individual here kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.  But some other individual here kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.  But some other individual here refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, or using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, and have right view.  When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.  But some other individual here refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misco",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 137  The Analysis of the Six Sense Fields  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I shall teach you the analysis of the six sense fields.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “‘The six interior sense fields should be understood. The six exterior sense fields should be understood. The six classes of consciousness should be understood. The six classes of contact should be understood. The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood. The thirty-six positions of sentient beings should be understood. Therein, relying on this, give up that. The Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases, by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to instruct a group. Of all meditation tutors, it is he that is called the supreme guide for those fit for training.’  This is the summary recital for the analysis of the six sense fields.  ‘The six interior sense fields should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  There are the sense fields of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.  ‘The six interior sense fields should be understood.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘The six exterior sense fields should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  There are the sense fields of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas.  ‘The six exterior sense fields should be understood.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  There are eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness.  ‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  There is contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.  ‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.  Hearing a sound with the ear …  Smelling an odor with the nose …  Tasting a flavor with the tongue …  Feeling a touch with the body …  Becoming conscious of an idea with the mind, one is preoccupied with an idea that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.  So there are six preoccupations with happiness, six preoccupations with sadness, and six preoccupations with equanimity. ‘The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘The thirty-six positions of sentient beings should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  There are six kinds of domestic happiness and six kinds of renunciate happiness. There are six kinds of domestic sadness and six kinds of renunciate sadness. There are six kinds of domestic equanimity and six kinds of renunciate equanimity.  And in this context what are the six kinds of domestic happiness?  There are sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the worldly pleasures of the flesh. Happiness arises when you regard it as a gain to obtain such sights, or when you recollect sights you formerly obtained that have passed, ceased, and perished.  Such happiness is called domestic happiness.  There are sounds known by the ear …  Smells known by the nose …  Tastes known by the tongue …  Touches known by the body …  Ideas known by the mind, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the worldly pleasures of the flesh. Happiness arises when you regard it as a gain to obtain such ideas, or when you recollect ideas you formerly obtained that have passed, ceased, and perished.  Such happiness is called domestic happiness.  These are the six kinds of domestic happiness.  And in this context what are the six kinds of renunciate happiness?  When you’ve understood the impermanence of sights—their perishing, fading away, and cessation—happiness arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those sights are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.  Such happiness is called renunciate happiness.  When you’ve understood the impermanence of sounds …  smells …  tastes …  touches …  ideas—their perishing, fading away, and cessation—happiness arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those ideas are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.  Such happiness is called renunciate happiness.  These are the six kinds of renunciate happiness.  And in this context w",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 138  A Summary Recital and its Analysis  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I shall teach you a summary recital and its analysis.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “A mendicant should thoroughly examine such that for the examiner, if consciousness were not scattered and diffused externally, nor stuck internally, it would not be anxious because of grasping.  When this is the case, there is no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.”  That is what the Buddha said.  When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.  Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,  “The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail.  Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha?”  Then those mendicants thought,  “This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.  He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.  Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”  Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said,  “May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.”  “Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.  Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you bypassed him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.  For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.  That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.  You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”  “Certainly he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.  That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.  We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.  Still, Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.  He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.  Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”  “Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, reverend,” they replied.  Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:  “Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:  ‘A mendicant should thoroughly examine such that for the examiner, if consciousness were not scattered and diffused externally, nor stuck internally, it would not be anxious because of grasping. When this is the case, there is no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.’  This is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary recital.  How is consciousness said to be scattered and diffused externally?  In this case, when a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, and consciousness follows after the features of that sight—tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features—consciousness is said to be scattered and diffused externally.  When they hear a sound with their ears …  When they smell an odor with their nose …  When they taste a flavor with their tongue …  When they feel a touch with their body …  When they know an idea with their mind, and consciousness follows after the features of that idea—tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features—consciousness is said to be scattered and diffused externally.  That’s how consciousness is said to be scattered and diffused externally.  And how is consciousness said to be not scattered and diffused externally?  In this case, when a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, but consciousness does not follow after the features of that sight—not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features—consciousness is said to be not scattered and diffused ext",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 139  The Analysis of No Strife  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I shall teach you the analysis of no strife.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Don’t indulge in sensual pleasure, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And don’t indulge in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.  Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One understood the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.  Know what it means to flatter and to rebuke.  Knowing these, avoid them, and just teach Dhamma.  Know how to evaluate different kinds of pleasure.  Knowing this, pursue inner pleasure.  Don’t talk behind people’s backs, and don’t speak sharply in their presence.  Don’t speak hurriedly.  Don’t insist on popular definitions and don’t overstep normal labels.  This is the summary recital for the analysis of no strife.  ‘Don’t indulge in sensual pleasure, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And don’t indulge in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  Indulging in the happiness of the pleasure linked to sensuality is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. It is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.  Breaking off such indulgence is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.  Indulging in self-mortification is painful, ignoble, and pointless. It is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.  Breaking off such indulgence is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.  ‘Don’t indulge in sensual pleasure, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And don’t indulge in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One understood the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:  right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.  ‘Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One understood the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘Know what it means to flatter and to rebuke.  Knowing these, avoid them, and just teach Dhamma.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  And how is there flattering and rebuking without teaching Dhamma?  ‘All those who indulge in the happiness of the pleasure linked to sensuality—low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless—are beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the wrong way.’  In speaking like this, one rebukes some here.  ‘All those who have broken off indulging in the happiness of the pleasure linked to sensuality are free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the right way.’  In speaking like this, one flatters some here.  ‘All those who indulge in self-mortification—painful, ignoble, and pointless—are beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the wrong way.’  In speaking like this, one rebukes some here.  ‘All those who have broken off indulging in self-mortification are free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the right way.’  In speaking like this, one flatters some here.  ‘All those who have not given up the fetter of continued existence are beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the wrong way.’  In speaking like this, one rebukes some here.  ‘All those who have given up the fetter of continued existence are free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the right way.’  In speaking like this, one flatters some here.  That’s how there is flattering and rebuking without teaching Dhamma.  And how is there neither flattering nor rebuking, and just teaching Dhamma?  You don’t say: ‘All those who indulge in the happiness of the pleasure linked to sensuality—low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless—are beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the wrong way.’  Rather, by saying this you just teach Dhamma:  ‘The indulgence is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.’  You don’t say: ‘All those who have broken off indulging in the happiness of the pleasure linked to sensuality are free o",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 140  The Analysis of the Elements  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the Magadhan lands when he arrived at Rājagaha.  He went to see Bhaggava the potter, and said,  “Bhaggava, if it is no trouble, I’d like to spend a single night in your workshop.”  “It’s no trouble, sir.  But there’s a renunciate already staying there.  If he allows it, sir, you may stay as long as you please.”  Now at that time a gentleman named Pukkusāti had gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha’s name.  And it was he who had first taken up residence in the workshop.  Then the Buddha approached Venerable Pukkusāti and said,  “Mendicant, if it is no trouble, I’d like to spend a single night in the workshop.”  “The potter’s workshop is spacious, reverend.  Stay as long as you please.”  Then the Buddha entered the workshop and spread out a grass mat to one side. He sat down cross-legged, set his body straight, and established mindfulness in his presence.  He spent much of the night sitting in meditation,  and so did Pukkusāti.  Then it occurred to the Buddha,  “This gentleman’s behavior is impressive.  Why don’t I question him?”  So the Buddha said to Pukkusāti,  “In whose name have you gone forth, mendicant? Who is your Teacher? Whose teaching do you believe in?”  “Reverend, there is the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  I’ve gone forth in his name.  That Blessed One is my Teacher,  and I believe in his teaching.”  “But mendicant, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”  “In the northern lands there is a city named Sāvatthī.  There the Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”  “But have you ever seen that Buddha?  Would you recognize him if you saw him?”  “No, I’ve never seen him,  and I wouldn’t recognize him if I did.”  Then it occurred to the Buddha,  “This gentleman has gone forth in my name.  Why don’t I teach him the Dhamma?”  So the Buddha said to Pukkusāti,  “Mendicant, I shall teach you the Dhamma.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, reverend,” replied Pukkusāti.  The Buddha said this:  “‘This person has six elements, six fields of contact, eighteen mental preoccupations, and four foundations.  Where they stand, the streams of conceiving do not flow. And where the streams of conceiving do not flow, they are called a sage at peace.  Do not neglect wisdom; preserve truth; foster generosity; and train only for peace.’  This is the summary recital for the analysis of the elements.  ‘This person has six elements.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  There are these six elements:  the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.  ‘This person has six elements.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘This person has six fields of contact.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  The fields of contact of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.  ‘This person has six fields of contact.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘This person has eighteen mental preoccupations.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.  Hearing a sound with the ear …  Smelling an odor with the nose …  Tasting a flavor with the tongue …  Feeling a touch with the body …  Becoming conscious of an idea with the mind, one is preoccupied with an idea that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.  So there are six preoccupations with happiness, six preoccupations with sadness, and six preoccupations with equanimity.  ‘This person has eighteen mental preoccupations.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘This person has four foundations.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  The foundations of wisdom, truth, generosity, and peace.  ‘This person has four foundations.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  ‘Do not neglect wisdom; preserve truth; foster generosity; and train only for peace.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  And how does one not neglect wisdom?  There are these six elements:  the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.  And what is the earth element?  The earth element may be interior or exterior.  And what is the interior earth element?  Anything internal, personal, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated. This includes:  head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, or anything else internal, personal, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 141  The Analysis of the Truths  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.  It is the teaching, advocating, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing of the four noble truths.  What four?  The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.  Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.  It is the teaching, advocating, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing of the four noble truths.  Mendicants, you should cultivate friendship with Sāriputta and Moggallāna.  You should associate with Sāriputta and Moggallāna.  They’re astute, and they support their spiritual companions.  Sāriputta is like one who gives birth,  while Moggallāna is like one who raises the child.  Sāriputta guides people to the fruit of stream-entry, Moggallāna to the highest goal.  Sāriputta is able to explain, teach, assert, establish, clarify, analyze, and reveal the four noble truths in detail.”  That is what the Buddha said.  When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.  Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants,  “Reverends, mendicants!”  “Reverend,” they replied.  Sāriputta said this:  “Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.  It is the teaching, advocating, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing of the four noble truths.  What four?  The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.  And what is the noble truth of suffering?  Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.  And what is rebirth?  The rebirth, inception, conception, regeneration, manifestation of the aggregates, and acquisition of the sense fields of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.  This is called rebirth.  And what is old age?  The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.  This is called old age.  And what is death?  The passing away, passing on, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, laying to rest of the corpse, and cutting off of the life faculty of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.  This is called death.  And what is sorrow?  The sorrow, sorrowing, state of sorrow, inner sorrow, inner deep sorrow in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering.  This is called sorrow.  And what is lamentation?  The wail, lament, wailing, lamenting, state of wailing and lamentation in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering.  This is called lamentation.  And what is pain?  Physical pain, physical unpleasantness, the painful, unpleasant feeling that’s born from physical contact.  This is called pain.  And what is sadness?  Mental pain, mental displeasure, the painful, unpleasant feeling that’s born from mind contact.  This is called sadness.  And what is distress?  The stress, distress, state of stress and distress in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering.  This is called distress.  And what is ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering’?  In sentient beings who are liable to be reborn, such a wish arises:  ‘Oh, if only we were not liable to be reborn! If only rebirth would not come to us!’  But you can’t get that by wishing.  This is: ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering.’  In sentient beings who are liable to grow old …  fall ill …  die …  experience sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, such a wish arises:  ‘Oh, if only we were not liable to experience sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress! If only sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress would not come to us!’  But you",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 142  The Analysis of Religious Donations  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.  Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī approached the Buddha bringing a new pair of garments. She bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha,  “Sir, I have spun and woven this new pair of garments specially for the Buddha.  May the Buddha please accept this from me out of sympathy.”  When she said this, the Buddha said to her,  “Give it to the Saṅgha, Gotamī.  When you give to the Saṅgha, both the Saṅgha and I will be honored.”  For a second time …  For a third time, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī said to the Buddha,  “Sir, I have spun and woven this new pair of garments specially for the Buddha.  May the Buddha please accept this from me out of sympathy.”  And for a third time, the Buddha said to her,  “Give it to the Saṅgha, Gotamī.  When you give to the Saṅgha, both the Saṅgha and I will be honored.”  When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,  “Sir, please accept the new pair of garments from Mahāpajāpati Gotamī.  Sir, Mahāpajāpati was very helpful to the Buddha. As his aunt, she raised him, nurtured him, and gave him her milk.  When the Buddha’s birth mother passed away, she nurtured him at her own breast.  And the Buddha has been very helpful to Mahāpajāpati.  It is owing to the Buddha that Mahāpajāpati has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.  It’s owing to the Buddha that she refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.  It’s owing to the Buddha that she has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and has the ethics loved by the noble ones.  It’s owing to the Buddha that she is free of doubt regarding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.  The Buddha has been very helpful to Mahāpajāpati.”  “That’s so true, Ānanda.  When someone has enabled you to go for refuge, it’s not easy to repay them  by bowing down to them, rising up for them, greeting them with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for them; or by providing them with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.  When someone has enabled you to refrain from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants, it’s not easy to repay them …  When someone has enabled you to have experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and the ethics loved by the noble ones, it’s not easy to repay them …  When someone has enabled you to be free of doubt regarding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation, it’s not easy to repay them  by bowing down to them, rising up for them, greeting them with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for them; or by providing them with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.  Ānanda, there are these fourteen religious donations to individuals.  What fourteen?  One gives a gift to the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.  This is the first religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to an independent Buddha.  This is the second religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to a perfected one.  This is the third religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of perfection.  This is the fourth religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to a non-returner.  This is the fifth religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of non-return.  This is the sixth religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to a once-returner.  This is the seventh religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of once-return.  This is the eighth religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to a stream-enterer.  This is the ninth religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry.  This is the tenth religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to an outsider who is free of desire for sensual pleasures.  This is the eleventh religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to an ordinary person who has good ethical conduct.  This is the twelfth religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to an ordinary person who has bad ethical conduct.  This is the thirteenth religious donation to an individual.  One gives a gift to an animal.  This is the fourteenth religious donation to an individual.

Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick, suffering, gravely ill.  Then he addressed a man,  “Please, worthy man, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:  ‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill.  He bows with his head to your feet.’  Then go to Venerable Sāriputta, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:  ‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill.  He bows with his head to your feet.’  And then say:  ‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of sympathy.’”  “Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Anāthapiṇḍika asked.  Sāriputta consented with silence.  Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to Anāthapiṇḍika’s home. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Anāthapiṇḍika,  “I hope you’re keeping well, householder; I hope you’re all right. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”  “I’m not keeping well, Honorable Sāriputta, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading, its growing, not its fading, is evident.  The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.  The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a strong leather strap around my head.  The winds slicing my belly are so severe, like a deft butcher or their apprentice were slicing open a cows’s belly with a sharp meat cleaver.  The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals. That’s how severe the burning is in my body.  I’m not keeping well, Honorable Sāriputta, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading, its growing, not its fading, is evident.”  “That’s why, householder, you should train like this:  ‘I shall not grasp the eye, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the eye.’  That’s how you should train.  You should train like this:  ‘I shall not grasp the ear, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the ear.’ …  ‘I shall not grasp the nose, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the nose.’ …  ‘I shall not grasp the tongue, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the tongue.’ …  ‘I shall not grasp the body, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the body.’ …  ‘I shall not grasp the mind, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the mind.’  That’s how you should train.  You should train like this:  ‘I shall not grasp sight, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on sight.’ …  ‘I shall not grasp sound …  smell …  taste …  touch …  idea, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on idea.’  That’s how you should train.  You should train like this:  ‘I shall not grasp eye consciousness, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on eye consciousness.’ …  ‘I shall not grasp ear consciousness …  nose consciousness …  tongue consciousness …  body consciousness …  mind consciousness, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on mind consciousness.’  That’s how you should train.  You should train like this:  ‘I shall not grasp eye contact …  ear contact …  nose contact …  tongue contact …  body contact …  mind contact, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on mind contact.’  That’s how you should train.  You should train like this:  ‘I shall not grasp feeling born of eye contact …  feeling born of ear contact …  feeling born of nose contact …  feeling born of tongue contact …  feeling born of body contact …  feeling born of mind contact, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the feeling born of mind contact.’  That’s how you should train.  You should train like this:  ‘I shall not grasp the earth element …  water element …  fire element …  air element …  space element …  consciousness element, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the consciousness element.’  That’s how you should train.  You should train like this:  ‘I shall not grasp form …  feeling …  perception …  choices …  consciousness, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on consciousness.’  That’s how you should train.  You should train like this:  ‘I shall not grasp the dimension of infinite space …  the dimension of infinite consciousness …  the dimension of nothingness …  the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’  That’s how you should train.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 144  Advice to Channa  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Now at that time the venerables Sāriputta, Mahācunda, and Channa were staying on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.  Now at that time Venerable Channa was sick, suffering, gravely ill.  Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahācunda and said to him,  “Come, Reverend Cunda, let’s go to see Venerable Channa and ask about his illness.”  “Yes, reverend,” replied Mahācunda.  And then Sāriputta and Mahācunda went to see Channa and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. Then Sāriputta said to Channa,  “I hope you’re keeping well, Reverend Channa; I hope you’re all right. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”  “Reverend Sāriputta, I’m not keeping well, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.  The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.  The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a strong leather strap around my head.  The winds slicing my belly are so severe, like a deft butcher or their apprentice were slicing open a cows’s belly with a sharp meat cleaver.  The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.  I’m not keeping well, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.  Reverend Sāriputta, I will commit suicide. I don’t wish to live.”  “Please don’t commit suicide!  Venerable Channa, keep going! We want you to keep going.  If you don’t have any suitable food, we’ll find it for you.  If you don’t have suitable medicine, we’ll find it for you.  If you don’t have a capable carer, we’ll find one for you.  Please don’t commit suicide!  Venerable Channa, keep going! We want you to keep going.”  “Reverend Sāriputta, it’s not that I don’t have suitable food,  or suitable medicine,  or a capable carer.  Moreover, for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love, not without love.  For it is proper for a disciple to serve the Teacher with love, not without love.  You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa will commit suicide blamelessly.’”  “I’d like to ask you about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”  “Ask, Reverend Sāriputta. When I’ve heard it I’ll know.”  “Reverend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?  Do you regard the ear …  nose …  tongue …  body …  mind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “Reverend Sāriputta, I regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’  I regard the ear …  nose …  tongue …  body …  mind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.”  “Reverend Channa, what have you seen, what have you directly known in these things that you regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’?”  “Reverend Sāriputta, after seeing cessation, after directly knowing cessation in these things I regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.”  When he said this, Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable Channa:  “So, Reverend Channa, you should regularly apply your mind to this instruction of the Buddha:  ‘For the dependent there is agitation. For the independent there’s no agitation.  When there’s no agitation there is tranquility.  When there is tranquility there’s no inclination.  When there’s no inclination there’s no coming and going.  When there’s no coming and going there’s no passing away and reappearing.  When there’s no passing away and reappearing there’s no this life or the next or between the two.  Just this is the end of suffering.’”  And when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and left.  Not long after those venerables had left, Venerable Channa committed suicide.  Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, Venerable Channa has committed suicide.  Where has he been reborn in his next life?”  “Sāriputta, didn’t the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personally?”  “Sir, there is a Vajjian village named Pubbajira.  There Channa had families who were friendly, intimate, and hospitable.”  “The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families.  But this is not enough for me",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 145  Advice to Puṇṇa  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Puṇṇa came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha,  “Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”  “Well then, Puṇṇa, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” replied Puṇṇa.  The Buddha said this:  “Puṇṇa, there are sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  If a mendicant approves, welcomes, and keeps clinging to them,  this gives rise to relishing.  Relishing is the origin of suffering, I say.  There are sounds known by the ear …  smells known by the nose …  tastes known by the tongue …  touches known by the body …  ideas known by the mind, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  If a mendicant approves, welcomes, and keeps clinging to them,  this gives rise to relishing.  Relishing is the origin of suffering, I say.  There are sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  If a mendicant doesn’t approve, welcome, and keep clinging to them,  relishing ceases.  When relishing ceases, suffering ceases, I say.  There are sounds known by the ear …  smells known by the nose …  tastes known by the tongue …  touches known by the body …  ideas known by the mind, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.  If a mendicant doesn’t approve, welcome, and keep clinging to them,  relishing ceases.  When relishing ceases, suffering ceases, I say.  Puṇṇa, now that I’ve given you this brief advice, what country will you live in?”  “Sir, there’s a country named Sunāparanta. I shall live there.”  “The people of Sunāparanta are wild and rough, Puṇṇa.  If they abuse and insult you, what will you think of them?”  “If they abuse and insult me, I will think:  ‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t hit me with their fists.’  That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.  That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”  “But if they do hit you with their fists, what will you think of them then?”  “If they hit me with their fists, I’ll think:  ‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t throw stones at me.’  That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.  That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”  “But if they do throw stones at you, what will you think of them then?”  “If they throw stones at me, I’ll think:  ‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t beat me with a club.’  That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.  That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”  “But if they do beat you with a club, what will you think of them then?”  “If they beat me with a club, I’ll think:  ‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t stab me with a knife.’  That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.  That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”  “But if they do stab you with a knife, what will you think of them then?”  “If they stab me with a knife, I’ll think:  ‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t take my life with a sharp knife.’  That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.  That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”  “But if they do take your life with a sharp knife, what will you think of them then?”  “If they take my life with a sharp knife, I’ll think:  ‘There are disciples of the Buddha who looked for a suicide weapon because they were horrified, repelled, and disgusted with the body and with life. And I have found this without looking!’  That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.  That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”  “Good, good Puṇṇa!  Having such self-control and peacefulness, you will be quite capable of living in Sunāparanta.  Now, Puṇṇa, go at your convenience.”  And then Puṇṇa welcomed and agreed with the Buddha’s words. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sunāparanta.  Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sunāparanta,  and stayed there.  Within that rainy season he confirmed around five hundred male and five hundred female lay followers. And within that same rainy season he realized the three knowledges.  Some time later he became fully extinguished.  Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, the gentleman named Puṇṇa, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away.  Where has he been reborn in his next life?”  “Mendicants, Puṇṇa was astute. He practiced in line with the teaching, and did not trouble me about the teachings.  Puṇṇa has become fully quenched.”  That is what the Buddha said.  Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the",

Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī together with around five hundred nuns approached the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,  “Sir, may the Buddha please advise  and instruct the nuns.  Please give the nuns a Dhamma talk.”  Now at that time the senior monks were taking turns to advise the nuns.  But Venerable Nandaka didn’t want to take his turn.  Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,  “Ānanda, whose turn is it to advise the nuns today?”  “It’s Nandaka’s turn, sir,  but he doesn’t want to do it.”  Then the Buddha said to Nandaka,  “Nandaka, please advise  and instruct the nuns.  Please, brahmin, give the nuns a Dhamma talk.”  “Yes, sir,” replied Nandaka. Then, in the morning, he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.  He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Royal Monastery with a companion.  Those nuns saw him coming off in the distance,  so they spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.  Nandaka sat down on the seat spread out,  and washed his feet.  Those nuns bowed, and sat down to one side.  Nandaka said to them,  “Sisters, this talk shall be in the form of questions.  When you understand, say so. When you don’t understand, say so.  If anyone has a doubt or uncertainty, ask me about it:  ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’”  “We’re already delighted and satisfied with Master Nandaka, since he invites us like this.”  “What do you think, sisters?  Is the eye permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, sisters?  Is the ear …  nose …  tongue …  body …  mind permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.  Why is that?  Because we have already truly seen this with right wisdom:  ‘So these six interior sense fields are impermanent.’”  “Good, good, sisters!  That’s how it is for a noble disciple who truly sees with right wisdom.  What do you think, sisters?  Are sights permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if they’re impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable, are they fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, sisters?  Are sounds …  smells …  tastes …  touches …  ideas permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if they’re impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable, are they fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.  Why is that?  Because we have already truly seen this with right wisdom:  ‘So these six exterior sense fields are impermanent.’”  “Good, good, sisters!  That’s how it is for a noble disciple who truly sees with right wisdom.  What do you think, sisters?  Is eye consciousness …  ear consciousness …  nose consciousness …  tongue consciousness …  body consciousness …  mind consciousness permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.  Why is that?  Because we have already truly seen this with right wisdom:  ‘So these six classes of consciousness are impermanent.’”  “Good, good, sisters!  That’s how it is for a noble disciple who truly sees with right wisdom.  Suppose there was an oil lamp burning. The oil, wick, flame, and light were all impermanent and perishable.  Now, suppose someone was to say:  ‘While this oil lamp is burning, the oil, the wick, and the flame are all impermanent and perishable.  But the light is permanent, lasting, eternal, and imperishable.’  Would they be speaking rightly?”  “No, sir.  Why is that?  Because that oil lamp’s oil, wick, and flame are all impermanent and perishable,  let alone the light.”  “In the same way, suppose someone was to say:  ‘These six interior sense fields are impermanent.  But the feeling—whether pleasant, painful, or neutral—that I experience due to these six interior sense fields is permanent, lasting, eternal, and imperishable.’  Would they be speaking rightly?”  “No, sir.  Why is that?  Because each kind of feeling arises dependent on the corresponding condition.  When the corresponding condition ceases, the appropriate fee",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 147  The Shorter Advice to Rāhula  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,  “The qualities that ripen in freedom have ripened in Rāhula.  Why don’t I lead him further to the ending of defilements?”  Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.  Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Rāhula,  “Rāhula, get your sitting cloth.  Let’s go to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.”  “Yes, sir,” replied Rāhula. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.  Now at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha, thinking,  “Today the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilements!”  Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out.  Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.  The Buddha said to him:  “What do you think, Rāhula?  Is the eye permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, Rāhula?  Are sights permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if they’re impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable, are they fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, Rāhula?  Is eye consciousness permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, Rāhula?  Is eye contact permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, Rāhula?  Anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises dependent on eye contact: is that permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, Rāhula? Is the ear …  nose …  tongue …  body …  mind permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, Rāhula? Are ideas permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if they’re impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable, are they fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, Rāhula? Is mind consciousness permanent or impermanent?”  “Impermanent, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”  “Suffering, sir.”  “But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:  ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”  “No, sir.”  “What do you think, Rāhula?

And they grow disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises dependent on eye contact.  They grow disillusioned with the ear …  nose …  tongue …  body …  mind, ideas, mind consciousness, and mind contact. And they grow disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises dependent on mind contact.  Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fad",

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I shall teach you the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And I shall reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure, namely,  the six sets of six.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “The six interior sense fields should be understood. The six exterior sense fields should be understood. The six classes of consciousness should be understood. The six classes of contact should be understood. The six classes of feeling should be understood. The six classes of craving should be understood.  ‘The six interior sense fields should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  There are the sense fields of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.  ‘The six interior sense fields should be understood.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  This is the first set of six.  ‘The six exterior sense fields should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  There are the sense fields of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas.  ‘The six exterior sense fields should be understood.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  This is the second set of six.  ‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights.  Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds.  Nose consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells.  Tongue consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes.  Body consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches.  Mind consciousness arises dependent on the mind and ideas.  ‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  This is the third set of six.  ‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact.  Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. The meeting of the three is contact.  Nose consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells. The meeting of the three is contact.  Tongue consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes. The meeting of the three is contact.  Body consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches. The meeting of the three is contact.  Mind consciousness arises dependent on the mind and ideas. The meeting of the three is contact.  ‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’  That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.  This is the fourth set of six.  ‘The six classes of feeling should be understood.’  That’s what I said, but why did I say it?  Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a requirement for feeling.  Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a requirement for feeling.  Nose consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a requirement for feeling.

This is the sixth set of six.  If anyone says, ‘the eye is self,’ that is not tenable.  The arising and vanishing of the eye is evident,  so it would follow that one’s self arises and vanishes.  That’s why it’s not tenable to claim that  the eye is self.  So the eye is not self.  If anyone says, ‘sights are self,’ that is not tenable.  The arising and vanishing of sights i",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 149  The Great Discourse on What Relates to the Six Sense Fields  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.  There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,  “Mendicants!”  “Venerable sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, I shall teach you the great discourse on what relates to the six sense fields.  Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” they replied.  The Buddha said this:  “Mendicants, when you don’t truly know and see the eye, sights, eye consciousness, eye contact, and what is felt as pleasant, painful, or neutral that arises dependent on eye contact, you’re aroused by these things.  Someone who lives aroused like this—fettered, confused, concentrating on gratification—accumulates the five grasping aggregates for themselves in the future.  And their craving—which leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure wherever it lands—grows.  Their physical and mental stress,  torment,  and fever grow.  And they experience physical and mental suffering.  When you don’t truly know and see the ear …  nose …  tongue …  body …  mind, ideas, mind consciousness, mind contact, and what is felt as pleasant, painful, or neutral that arises dependent on mind contact, you’re aroused by these things.  Someone who lives aroused like this—fettered, confused, concentrating on gratification—accumulates the five grasping aggregates for themselves in the future.  And their craving—which leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure wherever it lands—grows.  Their physical and mental stress,  torment,  and fever grow.  And they experience physical and mental suffering.  When you do truly know and see the eye, sights, eye consciousness, eye contact, and what is felt as pleasant, painful, or neutral that arises dependent on eye contact, you’re not aroused by these things.  Someone who lives unaroused like this—unfettered, unconfused, concentrating on drawbacks—disperses the five grasping aggregates for themselves in the future.  And their craving—which leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure wherever it lands—is given up.  Their physical and mental stress,  torment,  and fever are given up.  And they experience physical and mental pleasure.  The view of such a person is right view.  Their intention is right intention,  their effort is right effort,  their mindfulness is right mindfulness,  and their immersion is right immersion.  And their actions of body and speech, and their livelihood, have already been fully purified before.  So this noble eightfold path is fully developed.  When the noble eightfold path is developed, the following are fully developed: the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, and the seven awakening factors.  And these two qualities proceed in conjunction:  serenity and discernment.  They completely understand by direct knowledge those things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge.  They give up by direct knowledge those things that should be given up by direct knowledge.  They develop by direct knowledge those things that should be developed by direct knowledge.  They realize by direct knowledge those things that should be realized by direct knowledge.  And what are the things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge?  You should say: ‘The five grasping aggregates.’  That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.  These are the things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge.  And what are the things that should be given up by direct knowledge?  Ignorance and craving for continued existence.  These are the things that should be given up by direct knowledge.  And what are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge?  Serenity and discernment.  These are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge.  And what are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge?  Knowledge and freedom.  These are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge.  When you truly know and see the ear …  nose …  tongue …  body …  mind, ideas, mind consciousness, mind contact, and what is felt as pleasant, painful, or neutral that arises dependent on mind contact, you are not aroused by these things. …  These are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge.”  That is what the Buddha said.  Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said. ",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 150  With the People of Nagaravinda  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Nagaravinda.  The brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda heard,  “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Nagaravinda, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.  He has this good reputation:  ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’  He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.  He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.  It’s good to see such perfected ones.”  Then the brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. The Buddha said to them:  “Householders, if wanderers who follow another religion were to ask you:  ‘What kind of ascetic or brahmin doesn’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration?’  You should answer them:  ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed, hate, and delusion for sights known by the eye, who are not peaceful inside, and who conduct themselves badly among the good by way of body, speech, and mind. They don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.  Why is that?  Because we ourselves are not free of these things, so we do not see that they have any higher good conduct than us.  That’s why they don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.  There are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed, hate, and delusion for sounds known by the ear …  smells known by the nose …  tastes known by the tongue…  touches known by the body …  ideas known by the mind, who are not peaceful inside, and who conduct themselves badly among the good by way of body, speech, and mind. They don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.  Why is that?  Because we ourselves are not free of these things, so we do not see that they have any higher good conduct than us.  That’s why they don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.’  When questioned by wanderers of other religions, that’s how you should answer them.

If wanderers of other religions were to ask you:  ‘But what reasons and evidence do you have regarding those venerables that justifies saying,  “Clearly those venerables are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them”?’  You should answer them:  ‘It’s because those venerables frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.  In such places there are no sights known by the eye to see and enjoy, there are no sounds known by the ear to hear and enjoy, no odors known by the nose to smell and enjoy, no flavors known by the tongue to taste and enjoy, and no touches known by the body to feel and enjoy.  These are the reasons and evidence that you have regarding those venerables that justifies saying,  “Clearly those venerables are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them”.’  When questioned by wanderers of other religions, that’s how you should answer them.”  W",

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 151  The Purification of Alms  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.  Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,  “Sāriputta, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.  What kind of meditation are you usually practicing these days?”  “Sir, these days I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.”  “Good, good, Sāriputta!  It seems you usually practice the meditation of a great man.  For emptiness is the meditation of a great man.  Now, a mendicant might wish:  ‘May I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.’ So they should reflect:  ‘Along the path that I went for alms, or in the place I wandered for alms, or along the path that I returned from alms, was there any desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in my heart for sights known by the eye?’  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  there was such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart, they should make an effort to give up those unskillful qualities.  But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  there was no such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.  Furthermore, a mendicant should reflect:  ‘Along the path that I went for alms, or in the place I wandered for alms, or along the path that I returned from alms, was there any desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in my heart for sounds known by the ear …  smells known by the nose …  tastes known by the tongue …  touches known by the body …  ideas known by the mind?’  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  there was such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart, they should make an effort to give up those unskillful qualities.  But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  there was no such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.  Furthermore, a mendicant should reflect:  ‘Have I given up the five kinds of sensual stimulation?’  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they have not given them up, they should make an effort to do so.  But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they have given them up, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.  Furthermore, a mendicant should reflect:  ‘Have I given up the five hindrances?’  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they have not given them up, they should make an effort to do so.  But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they have given them up, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.  Furthermore, a mendicant should reflect:  ‘Have I completely understood the five grasping aggregates?’  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they have not completely understood them, they should make an effort to do so.  But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they have completely understood them, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.  Furthermore, a mendicant should reflect:  ‘Have I developed the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?’  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they haven’t developed them, they should make an effort to do so.  But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they have developed them, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.  Furthermore, a mendicant should reflect:  ‘Have I developed the four right efforts …  the four bases of psychic power …  the five faculties …  the five powers …  the seven awakening factors …  the noble eightfold path?’  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they haven’t developed it, they should make an effort to do so.  But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they have developed it, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.  Furthermore, a mendicant should reflect:  ‘Have I developed serenity and discernment?’  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they haven’t developed them, they should make an effort to do so.  But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they have developed them, they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.  Furthermore, a mendicant should reflect:  ‘Have I realized knowledge and freedom?’  Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that  they haven’t realized them, they should make an effort to do so.

    "text_english": "Middle Discourses 152  The Development of the Faculties  So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Kajaṅgalā in a bamboo grove.  Then the student Uttara, a pupil of the brahmin Pārāsariya, approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.  When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,  “Uttara, does Pārāsariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties?”  “He does, worthy Gotama.”  “But how does he teach it?”  “Worthy Gotama, it’s when the eye sees no sight and the ear hears no sound.  That’s how Pārāsariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties.”  “In that case, Uttara, a blind person and a deaf person will have developed faculties  according to what Pārāsariya says.  For a blind person sees no sight with the eye and a deaf person hears no sound with the ear.”  When he said this, Uttara sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.  Knowing this, the Buddha addressed Venerable Ānanda,  “Ānanda, the development of the faculties taught by Pārāsariya is quite different from the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One.”  “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One.  Let the Buddha teach the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”  “Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”  “Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.  The Buddha said this:  “And how, Ānanda, is there the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One?  When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, in them arises what is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable.  They understand:  ‘What is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable have arisen in me.  That’s conditioned, crude, and dependently originated.  But this is peaceful and sublime, namely  equanimity.’  Then the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease,  and equanimity becomes stabilized.  It’s like how a person with clear eyes might open their eyes then shut them; or might shut their eyes then open them.  Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which anything agreeable, disagreeable, and both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.  In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding sights known by the eye.  Furthermore, when a mendicant hears a sound with their ears, the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable arise in them.  They understand:  ‘What is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable have arisen in me.  That’s conditioned, crude, and dependently originated.  But this is peaceful and sublime, namely  equanimity.’  Then the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease,  and equanimity becomes stabilized.  It’s like how a strong person can effortlessly snap their fingers.  Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which anything agreeable, disagreeable, and both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.  In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding sounds known by the ear.  Furthermore, when a mendicant smells an odor with their nose, the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable arise in them.  They understand:  ‘What is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable have arisen in me.  That’s conditioned, crude, and dependently originated.  But this is peaceful and sublime, namely  equanimity.’  Then the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease,  and equanimity becomes stabilized.  It’s like how a drop of water would roll off a gently sloping lotus leaf, and would not stay there.  Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which anything agreeable, disagreeable, and both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.  In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding smells known by the nose.  Furthermore, when a mendicant tastes a flavor with their tongue, the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable arise in them.  They understand:  ‘What is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable have arisen in me.  That’s conditioned, crude, and dependently originated.  But this is peaceful and sublime, namely  equanimity.’  Then the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease,  and equanimity becomes stabilized.
